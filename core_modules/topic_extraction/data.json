A US Treasury Department later told Buzzfeed that an unclassified annex of the report had been derived from the magazine.\r\n\r\nWhy did the US publish the list?\r\n\r\nThe government was required to draw up the list after Congress passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa) in August.\r\n\r\nThe law aimed to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and its actions in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nCongress wanted the list to name and shame those who had benefited from close association with President Putin and put them on notice that they could be targeted for sanctions, or more sanctions, in the future.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump did not support Caatsa, even though he signed it into law, saying it was \"unconstitutional\".\r\n\r\nUnder the law, the list had to be delivered by Monday. The fact it was released about 10 minutes before midnight may reflect Mr Trump's coolness towards it, and his opposition to punishing more Russians with sanctions.\r\n\r\nThe top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, accused the Trump administration of letting \"Russia off the hook again\" by not taking substantial action.\r\n\r\nWho has been named?\r\n\r\nInformally known as the \"Putin list\", the unclassified section has 210 names, 114 of them in the government or linked to it, or key businessmen. The other 96 are oligarchs apparently determined more by the fact they are worth more than $1bn (\u00a3710m) than their close ties to the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Congress passed the law in August, although President Donald Trump had opposed it\r\n\r\nMost of Mr Putin's longstanding allies are named, many of them siloviki (security guys). They include the spy chiefs Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - which Mr Putin used to run - and Sergei Naryshkin of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).\r\n\r\nThe men who control Russia's energy resources are listed: Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, Rosneft chief Igor Sechin and other oil and gas executives, along with top bankers like Bank Rossiya manager Yuri Kovalchuk.\r\n\r\nThe oligarchs include Kirill Shamalov, who is reported to be Mr Putin's son-in-law, although the Kremlin has never confirmed his marriage to Katerina Tikhonova, nor even that she is the president's daughter.\r\n\r\nInternationally known oligarchs are there too, such as those with stakes in top English football clubs: Alisher Usmanov (Arsenal) and Roman Abramovich (Chelsea).\r\n\r\nWill they face new sanctions?\r\n\r\nNot at the moment. The US Treasury document itself stresses: \"It is not a sanctions list, and the inclusion of individuals or entities... does not and in no way should be interpreted to impose sanctions on those individuals or entities.\"\r\n\r\nIt adds: \"Neither does inclusion on the unclassified list indicate that the US government has information about the individual's involvement in malign activities.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a classified version said to include information detailing allegations of involvement in corrupt activities.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean for Russia's elite?\r\n\r\nAnalysis: Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent\r\n\r\nThe good news for the Kremlin: this isn't a sanctions list. But the good news ends there.\r\n\r\nThose Russian officials and oligarchs named by the US Treasury will worry that their inclusion could signal sanctions in the future.\r\n\r\nEven before the list was made public, the Kremlin had claimed the US Treasury report was an attempt to meddle in Russia's presidential election.\r\n\r\nThe list reads like a Who's Who of the Russian political elite and business world.\r\n\r\nMoscow won't want that to become a Who's Sanctioned.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Caatsa act and did the president want it?\r\n\r\nThe law limited the amount of money Americans could invest in Russian energy projects and made it more difficult for US companies to do business with Russia.\r\n\r\nIt also imposed sanctions on Iran and North Korea.\r\n\r\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation\r\n\r\nIn signing the act, Mr Trump attached a statement calling the measure \"deeply flawed\" and said he could make \"far better deals with foreign countries than Congress\".\r\n\r\nEarlier on Monday, the US government argued the Caatsa law had already pushed governments around the world to cancel deals with Russia worth billions, suggesting that more sanctions were not required.\r\n\r\nHow have the Russians reacted?\r\n\r\nPerhaps referring to the fact that all of their political representatives had been named, Mr Putin said that, in effect, \"all 146 million Russians have been put on the list\".\r\n\r\nHe joked he was offended not to be named himself.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who is himself on the list, accepted that it was not one of sanctions but said it could potentially damage \"the image and reputation\" of figures listed and their associated companies.\r\n\r\nHe added: \"It's not the first day that we live with quite aggressive comments made towards us, so we should not give in to emotions.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Caatsa was passed, PM Dmitry Medvedev said it meant the US had declared a \"full-scale trade war\" on Russia.\r\n\r\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny praised the publication of the names as \"a good list\"."}, {"id": 1, "text": "Husband admits

purse and a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nJailing him for four years and three months at Manchester Crown Court, Judge David Hernandez told Parker: \"You were not the hero you pretended to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge added: \"You were just a common thief.\"\r\n\r\nParker pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one of fraud after admitting using a debit card from the stolen purse.\r\n\r\nJudge Hernandez

an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May, killing 22 people and injuring many more.\r\n\r\nCCTV footage played in court showed Parker leaning over injured survivor Pauline Healey and taking her handbag to steal her purse, as her teenage granddaughter lay dying nearby.\r\n\r\nHours later, Parker was using Mrs Healey's bank card at a local McDonald's restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe court heard the footage also captured him taking photographs of the victims, including one of Mrs Healey.\r\n\r\nProsecutor Louise Brandon showed the judge four pictures Parker took in the foyer which, she said, he later sold for \u00a3100.\r\n\r\nShe said the CCTV footage shows Parker \"taking the opportunities that presented themselves to him to take photographs and to look for and, where possible, take valuable items, such as purses and mobile telephones from the bags of the victims\".\r\n\r\n\"As the tragedy unfolded around him, when the vast majority of those who were in the arena with him were trying to save lives and care for the injured and lost, the defendant was focused on seeking to take advantage of the situation,\" she added.\r\n\r\nImage copyright PA Image caption Salman Abedi detonated a home-made bomb in the foyer of the arena on 22 May last year\r\n\r\nParker also stole a mobile phone from a 14-year-old girl who was seriously hurt in the blast.\r\n\r\nMiss Brandon said the teenager had been holding it at the time of the explosion.\r\n\r\nParker then picked it up, the court heard.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor said the girl's phone rang a number of times as people tried to contact her, but Parker terminated one call with an automatic return text message which read: \"Sorry I can't talk right now.\"\r\n\r\nIn a victim personal statement, the girl's mother said the theft was \"yet another blow as to how despicable people could be\".\r\n\r\nSupt Chris Hill, from Greater Manchester Police, said: \"No matter what personal circumstances you might find yourself in, to steal from injured and terrified innocent people is deplorable.\r\n\r\n\"Parker exploited these people when they were at their most vulnerable and needed the help of those around them.\"\r\n\r\nThe judge told Parker he will serve half his sentence in custody before being released on licence.\r\n\r\nHe also banned him from Manchester city centre for 10 years.\r\n\r\nWhen the story of Parker's \"heroism\" was originally reported, an appeal on the crowdfunding website GoFundMe raised \u00a352,000.\r\n\r\nA spokesman for GoFundMe said Parker did not receive the money and it has been returned

"Image copyright AFP Image caption Sebastien Bras (l) took over his famed restaurant from his father Michel Bras (r) a decade ago\r\n\r\nA prestigious food guide has allowed a top French restaurant to publicly withdraw from its listings.\r\n\r\nSebastien Bras's Le Suquet restaurant in southern France held Michelin's three-star rating for 18 years.\r\n\r\nHe shocked the food world in September when he decided to give up his top rating, saying he no longer wanted to cook under the \"huge pressure\" of being judged by its inspectors.\r\n\r\nIt is the first time Michelin has ever allowed a restaurant to bow out.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult for us to have a restaurant in the guide which does not wish to be in it,\" Michelin spokesperson Claire Dorland Clauzel told AFP news agency. She said other restaurants had dropped out when chefs retired or the concept had changed.\r\n\r\nWhat did Mr Bras say exactly?\r\n\r\nThe gastronomic bible's decision comes after Mr Bras, 46, spoke out about no longer being able to deal with knowing that just one below-par dish could jeopardise his reputation.\r\n\r\n\"You're inspected two or three times a year, you never know when,\" he told AFP.\r\n\r\n\"Every meal that goes out could be inspected. That means that every day one of the 500 meals that leaves the kitchen could be judged.\"\r\n\r\nMr Bras's famed restaurant in Laguiole will not be featured in the 2018 edition of the Michelin guide to be published next Monday.\r\n\r\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Million dollar idea: The Michelin Guide\r\n\r\nWhat does it take to reach star quality?\r\n\r\nOriginally published in 1900 to guide French motorists to find food and lodging on the road, the Michelin guide is now exclusively dedicated to fine dining.\r\n\r\nTo be in for a chance of one of the coveted stars, restaurants first have to be in a region Michelin covers. In 2016, it made history by releasing its first-ever Singapore edition, in which it awarded stars to street stalls for the first time.\r\n\r\nResearchers for the secretive organisation whittle down the best-reviewed restaurants by food bloggers and critics, and only after scouts draft a shortlist, do inspectors make anonymous visits to evaluate the food.\r\n\r\nOne Michelin star represents a \"very good restaurant in its category\", while two stars denotes a restaurant boasting \"excellent cooking\" that is \"worth a detour\". Three stars, however, is the ultimate honour, afforded only to those restaurants that offer \"exceptional cuisine\" that is \"worth a special journey\".\r\n\r\nHow great is the pressure on top chefs?\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what the exact recipe is to receive a recommendation or star - but chefs have been chasing these accolades for decades.\r\n\r\nCurrently, 27 French restaurants are in the elite club of holding Michelin's maximum three-star rating.\r\n\r\nMr Bras, who took over his three-star restaurant from his father Michel Bras almost a decade ago, accepts that by relinquishing his stars, \"maybe I will be less famous\".\r\n\r\nLe Suquet was dubbed \"spellbinding\" by Michelin's guide and currently commands a price of up to \u20ac230 (\u00a3202; $285) for its fixed menus. Its chef says he is keen to \"start a new chapter\" in his restaurant's history, away from the ultra-competitive world of Michelin-star cooking.\r\n\r\nHe hopes he will soon be able to present tantalising dishes \"without wondering whether my creations will appeal to [the] inspectors\".\r\n\r\nHe confessed that, like \"all chefs\", he sometimes thought of fellow Frenchman Bernard Loiseau, who took his own life in 2003. Mr Loiseau took 10 years to achieve three stars and his death was widely linked to rumours that he would lose his third Michelin star.\r\n\r\nYou might also like:\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Bras's restaurant is the first to be removed voluntarily from the Michelin guide, it is not the first luxury eatery to shed its stars:\r\n\r\nIn 2005, the late Alain Senderens said he'd had enough of the agony of perfection and closed his three-star Art Nouveau Paris restaurant.

His decision to overturn a scheme - Daca - that shields these people from deportation outraged Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe president may touch on the subject as he is hoping to draw Democrats in with a deal to overturn these plans, in return for securing billions for a proposed border wall with Mexico, and cuts to legal immigration levels.\r\n\r\nAll eyes and cameras will be trained on at least 24 Democratic lawmakers who are bringing Dreamers as their guests to watch the show, according to ABC News.\r\n\r\n3.

Look at the volcano,\u201d the Santorini local said to me, pointing to what are in fact two small, black lava islands created by volcanic activity (and are the most recently formed pieces of land in the Eastern Mediterranean basin), called Palea Kameni (Old Burnt) and Nea Kameni (Young Burnt).\r\n\r\nWith sun-bleached, blue-shuttered houses dotted among rocks, and alabaster paved paths meandering between them, Santorini is the archetypal Greek island fantasy, an envy-inducing sight on travel brochures and Instagram posts. But beneath the glittering facade, there is a dark secret to its seductive prowess.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Europe\u2019s most endangered language?\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Greek word that can\u2019t be translated\r\n\r\n\u2022 The mystery behind Greece\u2019s temples\r\n\r\nSituated in the southern Aegean Sea, Santorini is a small, circular group of five Cycladic islands, made up of main island Thera; Therasia and Aspronisi at the periphery; and the two lava islands. All five surround a colossal, mostly drowned caldera, a bowl-shaped crater that forms when the mouth of a volcano collapses. But during the Bronze Age, approximately 5,000 years ago, Santorini was a single volcanic landmass called Stronghyle (which means \u2018round\u2019 in Greek), and one that played a crucial role in shaping history.\r\n\r\nAround that time, a civilisation started developing on the nearby island of Crete. The inhabitants were the Minoans, named for mythical King Minos, an enigmatic and educated people, who were warriors but also merchants, artists and seafarers. The Minoans\u2019 ancestry has been the subject of hot dispute: some believe they were refugees from Egypt's Nile Delta, while others say they hailed from ancient Palestine, Syria or North Mesopotamia. The most recent research says the Minoan civilisation was a local development, originated by early farmers who lived in Greece and south-western Anatolia. Whatever the case, there is little doubt that between 2600 and 1100BC a sublimely sophisticated and advanced civilisation thrived here. Excavations in Crete, especially in Knossos (the capital of Minoan Crete), have unearthed the remains of a spectacular palace, golden jewellery and elegant frescoes.\r\n\r\nOver the centuries, the Minoan empire extended over the island of Rhodes (309km east of Stronghyle) as well as parts of the Turkish coast and perhaps as far as Egypt and Syria. Stronghyle (now Santorini) was an especially important outpost for the Minoans due to its privileged position on the copper trade route between Cyprus and Minoan Crete.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe excavations in Akrotiri [a village in Santorini\u2019s south-west] have found three-storey houses, vast and elaborate palaces, Europe's first paved roads, running water and a spectacular sewage system,\u201d said Paraskevi Nomikou, assistant professor in geological oceanography and natural geography at the University of Athens.\r\n\r\nMost fascinating of all, Europe\u2019s first writing systems were found in buildings in Akrotiri and on the faces of Bronze Age rocks in the Cretan palaces of Knossos and Malia: it was here that the Minoans inscribed the first of their written words, initially in the form of Cretan Hieroglyphics and later in Linear A.\r\n\r\nCretan Hieroglyphs is an ancient script of around 137 pictorials that look like plants, animals, body parts, weapons, ships and other objects, and is believed to have been in use until 1700BC. Gradually, the Minoans refined Cretan Hieroglyphs down to the much more stylised Linear A, which took the linguistic helm until about 1450BC. Linear A had various numbers, 200 signs and also more than 70 syllable signs, making it more like language as we know it today (though both scripts remain undeciphered).\r\n\r\nRightfully, the creators of Europe\u2019s earliest written script have been hailed as the continent\u2019s first literate and advanced civilisation. And their intellectual achievements were only surpassed by their uninhibited way of living, celebrating the joy of life even at funerals, playing with bulls instead of killing them and living in blissful harmony with nature.\r\n\r\nAnd it was nature that finally decided to kill them.\r\n\r\nBetween 1627 and 1600 BCE, the Late Bronze Eruption (commonly called the Minoan or Santorini Eruption), perhaps the greatest eruption in 10,000 years, took place on Stronghyle.\r\n\r\nIt was nature that finally decided to kill them\r\n\r\n\u201cPrior to the eruption, the modern caldera did not exist. Instead a smaller caldera, from a much older eruption, formed a lagoon at the north of the island,\u201d Nomikou said. \u201cDuring the eruption, titanic flows of 60m-thick landslides of volcanic material fell onto the sea, triggering 9m-high tsunami waves that smashed onto the shores of Crete.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe waves may have reached western Turkey and even Israel.\r\n\r\nOnce the cataclysm ended, the modern caldera began to form (though conjuring into existence the modern Santorini would take several thousand years).\r\n\r\nFor the Minoans it was the beginning of the end. \u201cThe volcanic destruction decimated their commercial boats, and the huge amount of carbon dioxide that was released in the atmosphere disturbed the climate balance, destroying Minoan agriculture. All this gradually enabled the Mycenaeans [a Bronze Age civilisation that inhabited mainland Greece between 1600 and 1100 BCE] to seize their chance to put an end to Minoan independence.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut what startles Nomikou is that, unlike the ancient Roman town-city of Pompeii, which got buried in more than 6m of volcanic ash and pumice in the wake of Vesuvius in 79AD, no bodies have ever been found on Santorini.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy all appearances, the people of Santorini were warned in advance and escaped,\u201d she said. To this day, no-one knows where they went.\r\n\r\nBut if Santorini destroyed Europe\u2019s first great civilisation, it did not destroy language. Once the more-belligerent Mycenaeans ruled over the previous Minoan empire, they replaced Linear A with their own evolved version, Linear B, the first attested writing system of the Greeks, which eventually led to the Ancient Greek language that spread democracy, scientific reasoning, theatre and philosophy around the world.\r\n\r\nMore than 3,500 years after the mayhem, Bellonias is a proud owner of one of Santorini\u2019s traditional hillside cave settlements, carved straight into the volcanic caldera.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are the perfect air-conditioned houses. In the winter, the volcano sends heat your way and in the summer it chills you,\u201d he said with a grin.\r\n\r\nBellonias, an art collector who owns a cultural foundation with a library housing 35,000 books (including hundreds dedicated to Santorini), has been living on and off the island for almost 60 years now, having spent his childhood and formative years in Athens.\r\n\r\nSantorini is not for the faint of heart\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may surprise you, but what dwells in my mind is that smell,\u201d he told me. \u201cEvery time we came to the island from Athens when I was a child \u2013 we arrived at dawn from Piraeus; the voyage was a hard labour back then \u2013 I was hit by the smell of cavallines,the excrement of the horses that hauled locals and tourists up to Imerovigli, before Santorini, well, caught on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can still smell cavallines if you sacrifice the convenience of your car,\u201d he added, looking straight ahead at the volcanic islands, behind which fiery colours stretching from deep red to ultra-violet were brewing as the sun prepared to set.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have never been able to put these colours in words. I don\u2019t think anyone who has ever lived on this island has. They might be crimson, pink, orange, red, violet... I just can\u2019t put the sunset in words. For me it\u2019s a visceral feeling. Santorini is not for the faint of heart.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd he\u2019s probably right; it did destroy Europe\u2019s first civilisation, after all.\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Its rectilinear format, albeit one that can be carved into split-screens or grids, is simple, eye-catching and clean-lined.\r\n\r\nInstagram is used by design lovers as a form of self-expression, to communicate their sensibility and inspirations to others in a highly curated way that represents their personality and taste, along, potentially, with captions relaying personal insights.\r\n\r\nIn the form of still images or videos, Instagram can showcase a designer\u2019s work and publicise their business, and as such is a useful \u2013 and free - commercial tool. It\u2019s also a versatile visual medium: it allows photos and videos to be presented using the Stories feature or as carousels (various images attached to one post that are revealed by swiping the first picture).\r\n\r\nDesign-led Instagram handles are used by private individuals, small businesses, magazines such as Dezeen (see @dezeen) and It\u2019s Nice That (@itnsicethat), museums including Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York (@cooperhewitt) and London\u2019s Design Museum (@designmuseum) as well as larger companies such as design consultancy Pentagram (@pentagram) and furniture manufacturer Herman Miller (@hermanmiller).\r\n\r\nVia hashtags, Instagram connects peoples with a shared, very specific visual sensibility, yet in a way that is relatively organic and unpredictable. When someone responds favourably to another account\u2019s images, they could be anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Instagram design community is incredibly diverse, sharing everything from traditional design practices to niche art forms,\u201d says a spokesperson for the company.\r\n\r\nAnd while Twitter is seen as combative, Instagram is a safer, less judgmental space for exchanging images and thoughts in a direct, digestible way.\r\n\r\nAn image can be beautiful, relatable, funny, colourful, thought-provoking or moving \u2013 Justina Blakeney\r\n\r\nThis community has grown rapidly since Instagram was launched in 2010. By September 2017, it had 800 million users. One early adopter was Los Angeles-based designer and artist Justina Blakeney. She has a blog and online design shop called Jungalow and is author of The New Bohemians Handbook: Come Home to Good Vibes (Abrams, \u00a319.99). Her handle, @thejungalow, now has more than 880,000 followers, and the platform is perhaps the perfect showcase for her love of juicy colour and luxuriant botanical motifs.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on Instagram since early 2011,\u201d she says. \u201cA friend touted it to me as the new Twitter for visual people. It\u2019s my favourite social media platform because it\u2019s visual and simple. For me, many things make an image compelling \u2013 it can be beautiful, relatable, funny, colourful, thought-provoking or moving.\u201d\r\n\r\nUK-based Kate Watson-Smyth has a similarly multi-faceted business operating under the umbrella name Mad About the House. A design journalist, she has a blog and her Instagram handle @mad_about_the_house (with nearly 80,000 followers) is a visual diary, mainly showing images of her home accompanied by chatty captions. The moody, forest-green walls of her home are a unifying element in her feed, which British Vogue named one of Instagram\u2019s top 10 interiors accounts.\r\n\r\nI can spend an hour moving things left or right by an inch or two \u2013 Kate Watson-Smyth\r\n\r\n\u201cI post a new picture about 7am, Monday to Friday. I use it as a micro-blogging site, sometimes giving tips on interior design,\u201d says Watson-Smyth, also author of new book Mad About the House: How to Decorate Your Home with Style (Pavilion Books, \u00a320), to be published in March. Her images are painstakingly composed: \u201cI spend far too much time in pursuit of the perfect image and can spend an hour moving things left or right by an inch or two. I bought myself a very good camera last year and it has a grid on it to make sure I get my verticals vertical and horizontals horizontal.\u201d\r\n\r\nInterior life\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, French interior designer Pierre Yovanovitch, who joined Instagram in 2015 and has almost 80,000 followers (on @pierre.yovanovitch), says \u201cI immediately liked it. I was keen to get acquainted with a platform that is second nature to millennials as they are tomorrow\u2019s influencers. I like the interactivity of the images, too \u2013 you can zoom in on them, send them to another Instagram user...\u201d\r\n\r\nFor furniture designer and blogger Paddy Pike \u2013 who uses a Leica TL2 camera to post images of interiors and furniture he admires on his account @paddy.designs \u2013 the platform is a vital tool: \u201cIt\u2019s infinitely more cost-effective than most advertising as it\u2019s free. It\u2019s only a matter of time before designers put a large portion of their advertising budget into social media.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Miguel Flores-Vianna, a freelance interiors photographer, writer and author of Haute Bohemians (Vendome Press, \u00a345), whose Instagram handle @miguelfloresvianna has 64,000 followers, \u201cmy main motivation is to share what I experience. I travel a lot, see great things. I hope my images help my followers to learn about these places too. Instagram can be a generous tool and I admire those who use it this way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe vividly colourful Instagram page of London-based designer Camille Walala is a reflection of her eye-poppingly vibrant work, which takes the form of huge murals and boldly patterned homeware, and is influenced by 1960s Op Art and 1980s design collective Memphis. But there\u2019s more to it than that \u2013 it provides an insight into what makes her tick as a designer, since it includes myriad images of what influences her. \u201cAnything I see that inspires me I'll take a photo of. I\u2019ll upload it to Instagram and use it as part of my research,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\nAs Instagram\u2019s spokesperson points out: \u201cin addition to highlighting exceptional design, successful accounts engage with and nurture their communities by sharing behind-the-scenes, personal content you wouldn\u2019t see elsewhere.\u201d Indeed, seen collectively, an Instagram feed can look like a designer\u2019s private mood board \u2013 and one that can be added to ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nTo comment on and see more stories from BBC Designed, you can follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Welcome to the world of \"robo journalism\" - and it's coming faster than you think.\r\n\r\nSquirrelled away at the Press Association's (PA) headquarters in London is a small team of journalists and software engineers.\r\n\r\nThey're working on a computer system that can do the work of multiple human beings, picking out interesting local data trends - everything from crime statistics to how many babies are being born out of wedlock.\r\n\r\nAs part of a trial, the PA has begun emailing selected machine-generated stories, no more than several paragraphs or so in length, to local newspapers that might want to use such material.\r\n\r\n\"We've just been emailing them samples of stories we've produced and they've been using a reasonable number of them,\" says Peter Clifton, editor-in-chief.\r\n\r\nSometimes human journalists will rewrite or add to the algorithms' copy, but quite often, he says, it is published verbatim. Automated stories about smoking during pregnancy, recycling rates, or cancelled operations have all found their way online and in print.\r\n\r\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Press Association's Peter Clifton says automation could help, not harm, journalists\r\n\r\nThis \"robo-journalism\" is becoming increasingly popular throughout the world's newsrooms, as publishers struggle to cope with dwindling newspaper circulations and the switch to online advertising.\r\n\r\nMr Clifton hopes to be distributing 30,000 of these stories every month by the end of April. The project, called Radar - is a partnership with Urbs Media and is funded by a \u20ac706,000 (\u00a3620,000) grant from Google.\r\n\r\nBut how much of a journalist's workload can really be automated? And are jobs ultimately at risk?\r\n\r\nMr Clifton points out that, at this stage, the system simply amplifies the work human journalists do, some of whom are involved in developing the system's output. The automated part is currently limited to trawling through the data, something that would take humans far longer to do.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Shutterstock Image caption Automated stories are becoming more prevalent, but at what cost?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, stories churned out by machines are becoming more and more common, particularly in the US.\r\n\r\nThe LA Times' earthquake alerts, based on data from the US Geological Survey (USGS), have been automated since 2014.\r\n\r\nBut the risks of such systems became clear last June when the newspaper published a report about a 6.8 magnitude quake off the coast of California - it was actually a record of a 1925 earthquake that had been published by the USGS in error.\r\n\r\nThe LA Times' automated story had appeared just a minute after the USGS published its outdated report. In this case, being first to the news was definitely a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe odd hiccup has failed to deter publishers, however.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post announced last year that it would begin publishing automated stories about high school American football matches.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Tools of a bygone era?\r\n\r\n\"The stories will be automatically updated each week using box-score data submitted by high school football coaches,\" an article on the scheme explained.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, research revealed that thousands of stories a month are now being produced in European newsrooms with the help of algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe survey, from Oxford University's Reuters Institute of Journalism, found that many publishers are using automation to release interesting data quickly - from election results to official figures on social issues.\r\n\r\nThere are other uses, though. One agency in The Netherlands uses an algorithm to rewrite stories with simpler language, for a news wire aimed at children.\r\n\r\nWhile productive, most of these systems aren't overly sophisticated, concluded author of the report Alexander Fanta, then at the Austrian Press Agency.\r\n\r\nImage copyright PA Image caption Rupert Murdoch's News International clashed with UK print unions in 1986 over new technology\r\n\r\nBut more advanced tools are in the works.\r\n\r\nTencent, the Chinese tech giant behind the WeChat messaging app, recently showed off a system that could write a report about a speech automatically.

There is already evidence that automation has been used for such purposes on social media sites.\r\n\r\n\"There's a genuine concern that automation facilitates these kind of attacks on free speech,\" says Mr Fanta.\r\n\r\nThe BBC does not currently publish stories that have been generated by algorithms, says Robert McKenzie, editor of the corporation's News Labs research team.\r\n\r\nBut News Labs has worked on tools to automate other parts of journalists' jobs, he says, including \"the transcription of interviews and identification of unusual trends in public data\".\r\n\r\nMore Technology of Business\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images\r\n\r\nWhile AI is undoubtedly going to become more present in newsrooms, Joshua Benton at Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab doesn't think it yet poses a serious threats to jobs. There are far greater pressures, such as falling advertising revenues, he believes.\r\n\r\nAnd he also says the really difficult and most highly scrutinised part of what professional journalists do - carefully weighing information and presenting balanced, contextualised stories - will be very hard for machines to master.\r\n\r\n\"Good journalism is not just a matter of inputs and outputs, there is a craft that, however imperfect, has evolved over decades,\" he explains.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not saying that machines will never get there, but I think they're still a pretty long way away.\""}, {"id": 27, "text": "Video 1:02\r\n\r\nLily Cole: 'Get as much help as you can'"}, {"id": 28, "text": "Image copyright Hush Image caption The couple first met while Mr Youngman was on holiday in Hong Kong\r\n\r\nIt was a chance encounter that set Mandy Watkins and Rupert Youngman on the path to love, marriage and ultimately setting up popular womenswear brand Hush.\r\n\r\nIt was 18 years ago when the then complete strangers met in Hong Kong. Australian Ms Watkins lived and worked in the city, while Briton Mr Youngman was there on holiday.\r\n\r\n\"I was visiting a mutual friend and was just supposed to be staying there a week,\" says Mr Youngman. \"But I met Mandy and I ended up postponing the flight back.\"\r\n\r\nThe couple carried out a long-distance romance for 18 months before Ms Watkins quit her job and moved to London to be with her boyfriend.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody was going to have to move, and that somebody was going to be me,\" says the talkative 49-year-old in her strong Australian accent.\r\n\r\n\"I have an English grandmother, I'd already moved away, and it was easier this way - if he had moved to me and I decided I didn't fancy him, I'd had found that rubbish [to deal with],\" she laughs.\r\n\r\nThankfully it did work out for the couple, who have now been married for 12 years, and have two children.\r\n\r\nAnd their online fashion brand Hush, which they set up from their London home in 2003, now enjoys annual sales of \u00a317m.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Hush Image caption Hush started out selling pyjamas and cardigans\r\n\r\nCreating her own fashion brand was always the plan for Ms Watkins, who grew up in Melbourne inspired by her small business-owning mother and father.\r\n\r\n\"My parents worked for themselves running a couple of off-licences, and all their friends ran their own business,\" she says.\r\n\r\nUpon moving to the UK Ms Watkins started concocting her business plan for Hush, but without the money to launch a start-up, she initially had to continue her career in marketing.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until two years later when she lost her job with a UK mobile phone company that she was able to launch Hush from her kitchen table. Initially funded by her \u00a340,000 redundancy cheque, Hush started out selling women's pyjamas and cardigans.\r\n\r\n\"The whole idea was built around feeling cosy,\" says Ms Watkins. \"I'd moved to the northern hemisphere, and I had a big three-hour round commute.\r\n\r\n\"I'd come home [at the end of the day] and it would be dark and wet, and Roo [Rupert's nickname] would say 'fancy going out?'.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be like 'are you kidding me... no thank you. All I want to do is sit in my PJs with a good book'.\"\r\n\r\nImage copyright Hush Image caption The company's website and catalogues contain lifestyle magazine style articles and reviews\r\n\r\nHush soon gained momentum with fashion editors who started to mention the brand, and Mr Youngman joined the firm in 2005, giving up his previous job in publishing.\r\n\r\nThe company has since expanded to sell a wide range of casual and comfortable womenswear, including knitwear, dresses, leggings and coats. Plus shoes, bags, sunglasses and other accessories.\r\n\r\nOn a day-to-day basis Ms Watkins leads the design work at Hush, while Mr Youngman, 50, is in charge of marketing, finance and IT.\r\n\r\nTo engage as much as possible with its customers, the company's website and catalogues have lots of lifestyle magazine content, such as recipes, film reviews, travel articles and celebrity interviews.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Hush Image caption The summerwear range was slower to grow in popularity than Hush's winter clothing\r\n\r\nThis was the idea of Mr Youngman, who prior to owning his own publishing firm worked as a journalist.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking, 'how can I make myself useful?\" he says. \"Hush is very editorial. It's fair to say we were at the forefront of that; not because I'm a genius but because that's what my background was and I enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n\"Mandy was keen for it not just to be about product, it's about the lifestyle that goes with it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Hush continues to grow strongly - its annual revenues rose by 60% last year, and profits tripled - Ms Watkins and Mr Youngman admit some wrong turns and challenges along the way.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Hush Image caption The company is based in south London\r\n\r\nAn attempt to launch a menswear range in 2009 was unsuccessful, being discontinued three years later.\r\n\r\n\"I love what I do, but designing PJs for Roo [and men] rather than for me [and women] I'm not as interested in, says Ms Watkins. \"Therein lay the problem.\"\r\n\r\nAnother problem London-based Hush faced was that its lighter summer range took five years to make a profit, as customers instead preferred its snug and warm winter clothing.\r\n\r\nWhile sales come mostly via its website, Hush made its first move into High Street retail last year when it launched concessions in UK department store John Lewis.\r\n\r\nNow in 16 John Lewis stores, the plan is to roll out further concessions next year. There are, however, no plans to open standalone Hush stores.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Hush Image caption Hush has no plans to open its own stores\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I get really excited about the idea of a store and the idea of creating a concept,\" says Ms Watkins. \"But not that excited about when five years later it starts to look old - or the girl on a Sunday not turning up, and then having to go in myself.\"\r\n\r\nDespite competing against more well-established brands such as Jigsaw and Whistles, Hush has managed to target a niche in the increasingly competitive UK fashion market, says Global Retail Data lead retail analyst Honor Strachan.\r\n\r\n\"It has built a loyal following of 25 to 45-year-olds, while some of its more classic, yet still contemporary pieces, extend its reach to an older demographic,\" she says.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ms Strachan adds that Hush faces the challenge of an increasing level of competition.\r\n\r\n\"The likes of Mint Velvet, Finery and Modern Rarity are all targeting a similar customer,\" she says. \"So Hush must continue to evolve the brand, while also raising brand awareness to become a top of mind destination among the aspirational, stylish 30-plus market.\"\r\n\r\nMore The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world:\r\n\r\nDespite takeover offers, Hush remains 100% owned by Ms Watkins and Mr Youngman, and employs 71 members of staff. While the majority of the firm's online sales currently come from within the UK, the company does sell direct to customers around the world.\r\n\r\nMs Watkins and Mr Youngman say that 15 years after Hush was launched, and 13 years since he joined, they still enjoy working together.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't want to do it with anyone else,\" says Ms Watkins. \"But it does make you think what we used to talk about before Hush and the kids.

Soon after he found the older mice started showing signs of rejuvenation: better memory, improved agility, an ability to heal more quickly. In later years, researchers at institutions like Stanford would reinforce this work.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary technique became known as parabiosis, and forms the basis of efforts at Alkahest, a California start-up that is banking on being able to apply those rejuvenative effects to people, rather than mice. It's an idea so fantastical it wouldn't look out of place in an episode of Silicon Valley, the HBO send-up of the start-up scene.\r\n\r\nAnd to all intents and purposes, it was.

But elsewhere in the \"longevity space\", as I heard it called, we see something more low-key, backed up with something at least approaching a scientific consensus.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to start there. HVMN - pronounced human - is a start-up that encourages smart fasting. It is of course something that humans have done for thousands of years, but it's only in our more recent history that we've understood more fully how the body reacts, and more importantly, what it produces while we're deep into a fast.\r\n\r\nBeginning on a Monday night, I started the Monk Fast - 36 hours in which I could only drink zero-calorie liquids. In my case, that meant a diet of just water and black coffee.\r\n\r\n\"My advice to you is sleep in really late so you don't have to deal with it,\" Ms Brown joked.\r\n\r\nHere come the ketones\r\n\r\nStaying in bed wasn't an option. The following morning I skipped breakfast (for the first time in years) and met Geoffrey Woo, chief executive and co-founder of HVMN.\r\n\r\nThe company focuses on products Mr Woo claims can boost the effects of fasting. According to the company's Biohacker Guide, there is a \"growing body of scientific research\" that showed \"health benefits including longevity, improved metabolic state, improved insulin resistance, and cognitive improvement\".\r\n\r\nMr Woo says depriving yourself of nutrition provokes the body to produce ketones, a byproduct of your organs turning to your stored fat for fuel.\r\n\r\nImage caption A blood test appeared to show my ketone levels did increase after trying HVMN's product\r\n\r\n\"As one gets better at being in ketosis,\" he told me, \"it becomes a productivity boost.\"\r\n\r\nThe UK's NHS has warned about ketosis as a result of a low-carb diet which can be linked to headaches, weakness, nausea, dehydration, dizziness and irritability.\r\n\r\nTo help with my own fasting, I tried one of HVMN's products, a \"super fuel drink\" that is supposed to almost instantly get my body to start producing ketones at a level that would ordinarily take several days of fasting, not the mere few hours I had achieved by that point. To begin, we did a quick blood test to measure the current level of ketones in my body. It was low - 0.2 millimolar.\r\n\r\nThe $30 (\u00a321)-a-pop supplement - officially classified as a food by the US regulator - came in a small plastic bottle that in a former life might have held cheap aftershave. I unscrewed the top and knocked back the substance like a shot of suspect liquor, going back for a second effort to finish off the last drop. HVMN has valiantly tried to mask the smell of it, but it could do little about the bitter, sharp taste.\r\n\r\nSome 30 minutes later, we repeated the test. I didn't feel remarkably different, but my ketone level suggested otherwise: 2.2.\r\n\r\n\"It's the equivalent to having fasted for three or four days,\" Mr Woo explained.\r\n\r\n'Lunacy'\r\n\r\nThe question is: do I believe him?\r\n\r\nIn the run-up to filming our story, I'd read about how HVMN apparently hid away a report it had commissioned into the effects of Sprint, another one of its products. The unfortunate conclusion was that it had little effect on alertness beyond that of a strong cup of coffee. Headlines at the time suggested the company did what it could to stifle the report's publication, but Mr Woo insists that wasn't the case. Indeed, the company now links to the study - which Mr Woo co-authored - on its website.\r\n\r\nImage caption Eric Verdin, (R), has concerns about using young blood to rejuvenate the old\r\n\r\nTo find out more, I drove to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging which is based in the beautiful city of Novato, near California's wine country. It's the kind of place that would make you want to live as long as possible.\r\n\r\nHere I met Dr Eric Verdin, one of the world's foremost experts on the science of ageing.\r\n\r\n\"Fasting elicits a response in your body that triggers a protection against many of the diseases that are associated with ageing\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"So there's growing realisation that multiple forms of fasting might actually be beneficial in the long term. The science is really strong in this area.\"\r\n\r\nHe was less persuaded by Alkahest's claims of using young blood to rejuvenate the old.\r\n\r\n\"First let's talk about science in mice. It is amazing work, the science is strong.\r\n\r\n\"Taking this and bringing it to humans is a completely different story. The idea that one would take human plasma and give it to humans to prevent ageing is, in my opinion, lunacy.\"\r\n\r\nTrials ahead\r\n\r\nBut to be clear, Dr Verdin's concern with Alkahest, and other companies like it, was mostly about safety and risk of infection, owing to the current process this technique requires today.\r\n\r\nAs for the possibility it would work, he says we simply don't know.\r\n\r\nAlkahest chief executive Karoly Nikolich is confident but acknowledged the lack of solid science.\r\n\r\nHe told the BBC that a small study of 18 people suffering from early-stage Alzheimer's had shown positive results. Once a week over four weeks they were each given one unit of plasma taken from, probably, a student aged 18-30.\r\n\r\nOver time, Mr Nikolich said those patients showed a better ability to perform basic daily tasks, and were more aware of their surroundings and sense of self.\r\n\r\nBut anecdotal evidence on how someone feels and acts is hardly conclusive. A more formal study presented by the company to an Alzheimer's conference in Boston last year couldn't even prove minimal benefits.\r\n\r\nThe company is pressing ahead, buoyed by other academic studies that built on Paul Bert's work and discovered that something in young mouse blood can fight Alzheimer's in the older mouse - they just haven't figured out what it is yet.\r\n\r\nSpanish medical company Grifols recently invested $40m in Alkahest, and as a result will be a partner as it solicits blood donations from young people all over the world to be used in longer, more far-reaching studies.\r\n\r\nThe holy grail in this industry would be discovering specifically what can fight ageing - and bottling it.\r\n\r\n\"Ultimately we might be able to identify agents that could be administered orally,\" Mr Nikolich said, while predicting it might take more than a decade.\r\n\r\nImage caption French scientist Paul Bert pioneered much of the research that backs today's anti-ageing efforts\r\n\r\nBreaking fast\r\n\r\nBy Tuesday night, my own attempts to reverse the ageing process had left me feeling 20 years older. It was over 24 hours since my last calorie, and I was struggling.\r\n\r\nI'd spent the evening at the cinema after a friend suggested - incorrectly - that it would take my mind off food.\r\n\r\nWhat I found was that while fasting my mind became unable to process multiple inputs at once. After parking and getting out of the car, I started walking towards the cinema - only for my friend to point out that not only had I not locked the car, but the engine was still running.\r\n\r\nBy Wednesday I felt a little better, but still uneasy on my feet. My 36 hours were up, and after inhaling pancakes at one of Oakland's finest breakfast spots, I came to the conclusion that while scientists may be learning that fasting can indeed give you a longer life, there's no way they can convince me it'll be a happier one. You're not you when you're hungry, as the slogan goes.\r\n\r\nMy own rumbling tummy aside, is Silicon Valley on course to achieve its goal?\r\n\r\n\"We see the body as a platform to innovate,\" said Mr Woo, but Mr Verdin sees tech's contribution slightly differently.\r\n\r\n\"They're bringing incredible resources,\" he said\r\n\r\nBy which of course, he means cash. There's oodles of it pouring into this - and of all the daft ideas backed in this part of the world, I guess living longer and being healthier is something worth putting some money behind - lest we start stitching teenagers to billionaires."}, {"id": 58, "text": "Image copyright EPA\r\n\r\nFew people knew what to expect.\r\n\r\nWould this be belligerent Trump - wagging his finger at the global elite about how divorced they were from reality, from what people really want?\r\n\r\nOr would this be conciliatory Trump, setting a different tone?

America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade.\r\n\r\nWhich may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines.\r\n\r\nMr Trump's argument is this:\r\n\r\nThe rules of the free trade world were built after the Second World War when America's economic interests were rooted in the successful development of other countries' economies.\r\n\r\nThese countries then became eager customers for American products.\r\n\r\nThat equation has changed. China is a much more powerful economy.\r\n\r\nImage copyright AFP\r\n\r\nThe Asian emerging markets, South America and Europe all now have much more muscular dogs in the fight for global trade.\r\n\r\nMr Trump said state planning, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies were the new weapons of trade wars - and used against America.\r\n\r\n\"Fair and reciprocal trade\" is the new US mantra.\r\n\r\nAnd if the administration feels it does not receive such treatment, the president will act - for example, by passing an executive order pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Asian trade deal.\r\n\r\nMutual benefit\r\n\r\nIt's a message that has not fallen on stony ground here.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it's inappropriate that we re-look at some of the treaties that were so asymmetric,\" Larry Fink, the chief executive of investment company BlackRock, told me.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these countries now are very strong and very developed. It's going to be a long game.\r\n\r\n\"The world is benefitting by global trade and we need to find ways of creating more global trade to benefit more humanity worldwide,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAmerica is still a trading nation, one which gains far more economically from globalisation - world trade - than it does from protectionist measures.\r\n\r\nAnd that brute economic truth means that Mr Trump has to play a different tune here - to the business leaders and investors who decide where to place their cash - than maybe to the left-behind voters of the US rust belt.\r\n\r\nSo the president said that America was ready to do bilateral deals that would be \"mutually beneficial\".\r\n\r\nHe even suggested a re-engagement with the TPP. On trade, this was Trump 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe politics might have been angry in the past, but today, economic reality softened the president."}, {"id": 59, "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\r\n\r\nIf the Tory party had wanted intentionally to display just how divided they are over Brexit and how generally twitchy they are, they could hardly have done a better job.\r\n\r\nNot in off-the-cuff remarks but in scripted comments, one of the most convinced Brexit \"softies\" in the Cabinet, the chancellor himself, told delegates in Davos that he believed, hopefully, that the changes between the EU and UK economies would be \"very modest\", as we leave the European bloc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the emboldened voice of backbench Brexiteers, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had prepared a speech of his own, accusing ministers of being cowed by the EU and calling for the government to stiffen its sinews in the Brexit talks or risk letting down voters and opting only for a \"managed decline\".\r\n\r\nBefore you switch off from this neat, yet predictable demonstration of the division inside the governing party, remember it matters because it will shape the decisions that are made about the country's relationship with the EU in years to come, which will have an impact on all of our lives.\r\n\r\nAnd it constrains Theresa May's ability to keep the show on the road. She has, since moving into Number 10, had to balance the two wings of her party, and particularly pay attention to the Brexiteers.\r\n\r\nThe sheer force of numbers of them on the backbenches and her lack of majority mean they are essentially her domestic base. It's not always been easy, but until now, they have been quite peaceable in public, relatively speaking.\r\n\r\nThe conventional logic has been that while they are on board Theresa May is safe, and while not ardent fans, they have been content to support her in office, knowing they are able to wield significant private influence to deliver what they see as \"their\" Brexit.\r\n\r\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Philip Hammond's comments at Davos attracted some criticism\r\n\r\nIn the last ten days or so, with talk of transition, but more to the point the political mishandling of the reshuffle and the perceived tin ear of Number 10 on other issues, some ardent Brexiteers are looking at the Tories' prospects and wondering if it's time to change their calculation.\r\n\r\nOne senior Tory told me: \"Brexit has been so mishandled, whether we are right or wrong, we know it's bleeding into the party's prospects. In whose interests is it that she continues leading the party? A handful of cabinet ministers who can't summon up the wit to do anything.\"\r\n\r\nEssentially, Brexiteers were content to back the prime minister as long as it looked like she was more or less on track to lead the party and the government through a departure of the EU that was broadly to their liking, with a clean break from the single market and the customs union, a focus on free trade and cutting immigration.\r\n\r\nAnd arguably after the election, their hand was strengthened given they were the biggest group on the Tory backbenches and Theresa May also had to rely on the DUP, who are also Brexiteers, to survive.\r\n\r\n'Regime change'\r\n\r\nBut a perceived softening in her position, over the transition period, as we discussed earlier and a series of political missteps has, for some MPs at least, changed that calculation.\r\n\r\nFor some, \"we are now in a regime change state of mind\", with the possibility of seeking opportunities to remove the prime minister on the agenda.\r\n\r\nAnd their putative leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of the influential ERG grouping of Brexiteers hinted that there could be trouble in the Commons on our Brexit podcast, saying they hoped to change the government's Customs Bill, by coincidence of course, a bill politically owned by one Philip Hammond.\r\n\r\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Davis v Jacob Rees-Mogg on Brexit transition\r\n\r\nThat would be the first time that Brexiteers have made trouble publicly for the government's programme of legislation and raises the prospect of rebels to the right of the prime minister, and rebels to the [Tory] left of her, with no way out.\r\n\r\nOne Tory source told me: \"I've never known this level of frustration amongst colleagues. It feels like nothing is happening. No one thinks it can carry on like this and something has to give - that's probably Theresa. The question is when? The answer is, hopefully soon.\"\r\n\r\nBut - this is important - take a deep breath.\r\n\r\nNone of this means that it is inevitable that Theresa May is on her way out.\r\n\r\nNone of this means there will even be a challenge.\r\n\r\nAnd none of this means a spring breeze couldn't sweep away the sour mood in a couple of weeks' time.\r\n\r\nLosing patience\r\n\r\nNumber 10 is convinced that the fundamentals haven't changed. It's likely the majority of MPs, and almost certainly the majority of ministers, think she should stay on.\r\n\r\nA leadership contest in the middle of Brexit? The EU would be appalled. And how many members of the public would look kindly on yet another political drama? We can all guess the answer to that.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is absolutely the case that the Tories agree on neither a clear way forward on Brexit, nor a best potential successor, nor even a vision of the kind of party they really want to be and policies they want to pursue in the future.\r\n\r\nNo-one in the party can agree on a better answer to the status quo. And remember, it is always easy in politics to say, \"we can't go on like this\".\r\n\r\nYet even MPs who back the prime minister are losing patience.

A platform will use its own thrusters to do this.\r\n\r\nSES said that, as a consequence of Thursday's anomaly, SES-14 would need an additional four weeks to reach the allocated orbital slot at 47.5 degrees West, 36,000km above the coast of northern South America.\r\n\r\nSES-14 has an electric propulsion system that raises its orbit slowly but with great fuel efficiency. It was originally due to be on-station in July. The delay means August is now the expected arrival time.\r\n\r\nThe operator said the 15-year lifetime of SES-14 had not been compromised.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Yahsat said its platform, Al Yah-3, had been \"inserted into an orbit that differed from the flight plan\".\r\n\r\nAl Yah-3, built by Orbital ATK in the US, carries a conventional chemical propulsion system. And although this does not have the fuel efficiency of electric thrusters, Yahsat seems confident the spacecraft will eventually reach the desired position in the sky.\r\n\r\n\"We are pleased to know that the satellite is healthy, and that the necessary steps are being taken to ensure the original mission is fulfilled,\" Masood M Sharif Mahmood, CEO at Yahsat, said in a statement.\r\n\r\nImage copyright ESA/ARIANESPACE Image caption The Ariane 5 has had an unblemished record since 2003\r\n\r\nWhat happened during Thursday's flight was highly unusual.\r\n\r\nAfter a difficult introduction in the late 1990s, the Ariane 5 has since set a benchmark for reliability in the launcher business.\r\n\r\nBefore this mission, it had gone to space 82 times on the trot without mishap.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry will try to determine what exactly went wrong and will assess whether any changes are required to the vehicle's design or operation to ensure there is no repeat telemetry loss in future.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, preparations for further launches from Kourou will \"proceed as scheduled\", Arianespace said.\r\n\r\nOn the current calendar, the rocket is due to make up to six more flights this year.\r\n\r\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"}, {"id": 61, "text": "Image copyright Square Enix Image caption Life Is Strange, which was released in 2015, featured heroin and cannabis\r\n\r\nA study of real and made-up drugs in best-selling video games has highlighted how harmful narcotics often give unlikely strength and health boosts to characters.\r\n\r\nThe report also details how players are often prompted to create drug cocktails to gain new or enhanced abilities.\r\n\r\nThe work was done by Archstone, an addiction awareness organisation.\r\n\r\nIt said parents needed to be cautious about what their children are playing and learning.\r\n\r\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), which assigns age and content ratings to games in the US, says it is happy with its drugs-related guidance.\r\n\r\n\"The ESRB's robust rating submission process ensures accurate, detailed and reliable rating information that parents are aware of, regularly use and trust to help decide which games and apps are appropriate for their children and family,\" said a spokeswoman.\r\n\r\nEver since Mario powered himself up with mushrooms, allusions to drug use have become commonplace, but as games - and the people who play them - have matured, so has the depiction of mind- and body-altering substances.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Bethesda Image caption The Fallout games feature fictional drugs, including Jet, Mentats and Buffout\r\n\r\n\"Whether portrayed with gritty realism or eye-rolling cheesiness, it appears drugs in video games are here to stay,\" Archstone's report concedes.\r\n\r\nThe organisation runs a drugs recovery centre-based in Palm Beach, Florida.\r\n\r\nIts leader, Logan Freedman, took the top-100-selling games on each console and examined those featuring drug use, whether substances found in the real world, such as opioids, or fictional drugs, like Grand Theft Auto's Spank.\r\n\r\nIt found that in the games that featured drug use, the majority - 61% - used real-world names.

Dawn light suppresses the melatonin, waking us up and giving us a boost for the day ahead. This is the circadian rhythm - our internal body clock.\r\n\r\nThis is why some experts think the blueish light produced by smartphones and laptops can interfere with our sleep patterns if we use them too much before going to bed. Light on the red end of the spectrum, on the other hand, can help us relax.\r\n\r\nMichael Herf, a former Google employee, created a computer program called f.lux to address this issue.

Bedside lamps can now be turned into sunrise alarms in the morning, then switch to redder light at night.\r\n\r\nThese programmable smart lights - a feature of the increasingly connected home - are giving people far more control over the ambience in their homes.\r\n\r\nFor example, Briana Hokanson, who works in California for Adobe, has programmed her SmartHome hub \"to automate a better environment\".\r\n\r\n\"I had a setting that at 8.30pm all the smart bulbs in the house would dim to 30% and switch to a warm temperature, and after 11pm the bulbs would emit red hues,\" she says.\r\n\r\nImage copyright UpLight Image caption Would a pink lighting scheme help you get off to sleep?\r\n\r\nAnd it's not just householders who are experimenting with adjustable lighting - businesses are waking up to its potential, too.\r\n\r\nEnergy company Innogy has just installed \"tuneable\" lights in its new Prague headquarters. The lights provide bursts of blue light in the mornings and after lunch by default, but employees can change the settings if they prefer calmer light.\r\n\r\nCompanies like Innogy are realising the increasing importance of \"light nutrition\" in the workplace, says Dutch scientist Bianca van der Zande, who worked on the project as Philips Lighting's head of human-centric lighting.\r\n\r\nThe brain is so sensitive to differences between red and blue light, we can even be tricked into feeling warmer or cooler, claims Anna Enright, head of product management for UK-based lighting company, Aurora Lighting.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Philips Image caption Innogy's adaptable office lighting is designed to stimulate employee energy levels\r\n\r\n\"In Scandinavia, we use warmer light temperatures for clients, whereas the Middle East is quite a hot climate, so we use cooler light temperatures to make people think the air conditioning is working,\" she says.\r\n\r\nNo-one is claiming lighting alone can cure something as serious as clinical depression and we know manufacturers are fond of making overblown claims for their products, but there is growing evidence that managing our lighting can improve our sleep patterns and put a bit more pep in our step.\r\n\r\nAnd that may be enough to banish the January blues for many.\r\n\r\nFollow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook\r\n\r\nMore Technology of Business"}, {"id": 65, "text": "Video\r\n\r\n'Anyone can jump in and design something'"}, {"id": 66, "text": "Image copyright Graze Image caption Graze found that its nut packs were a bit hit in the US\r\n\r\nWhile curry-mad Britons can't get enough mango chutney, it seems that Americans can't stand the sticky stuff.\r\n\r\nThat was what popular UK snacks firm Graze found out pretty quickly when it first expanded to the US in 2013.\r\n\r\n\"Our plan in the US was to initially launch our entire British range and see how everything went down,\" says Graze's chief executive Anthony Fletcher.\r\n\r\n\"Some things Americans loved, and some they absolutely loathed... [such as] mango chutney. They were saying 'what is this acidic yellow blob?'.\"\r\n\r\nRevenue potential\r\n\r\nFor many UK food and drink companies cracking the US is the holy grail.\r\n\r\nWith its population of more than 326 million people, the giant American marketplace can offer British grub and booze businesses huge revenues.\r\n\r\nBut as the UK's largest supermarket group Tesco can attest, being a success stateside is far from easy. Back in 2013 it sold its six-year-old Californian venture Fresh & Easy after losses totalling more than \u00a31bn ($1.4bn).\r\n\r\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How snack food firm Graze cracked the US\r\n\r\nSo how exactly can a UK food and drink firm conquer the US? We asked a number of companies who have done just that to reveal the secrets of their success.\r\n\r\nGraze's Antony Fletcher says that his company sat down and formulated a plan whereby they would study their US online sales data to quickly work out exactly which of its snack food packs Americans wanted to buy, which ones they didn't like, and which ones could be adapted to better meet US tastes.\r\n\r\n\"We are very lucky in that we sell via our website,\" he says. \"And we get 15,000 product ratings an hour, which gives us a huge advantage - we can find out very quickly what people like and don't like.\"\r\n\r\nDiffering tastes\r\n\r\nSo, launching in the US with its entire range of products, within days Graze found out that American customers loved its packs of mixed nuts, but couldn't cope with things like the already-mentioned mango chutney, or the firm's \"deconstructed Jaffa Cakes\".\r\n\r\nThe latter wasn't bought in the US because American consumers didn't know anything about Jaffa Cakes, the popular UK orange and chocolate-topped mini-cakes.\r\n\r\nGraze soon trimmed back what was available to US customers, and used their reviews to change the formulas of other products, such as its barbeque sauce. It also quickly introduced some US specific lines, such as \"Creamy Range Kern Pops\", which is popcorn with a \"creamy, zesty kick\".\r\n\r\nMr Fletcher says that Graze also studied how long the various US delivery firms took to get its snack boxes to customers' doors, so that it could chose the quickest in each state.\r\n\r\nToday US sales account for half of the company's \u00a375.8m annual revenues.\r\n\r\nMarketing changes\r\n\r\nDavid Wilson's claim to fame is that he introduced the vegetarian version of chicken nuggets to the US market.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Quorn Image caption Quorn brought its meat substitute nuggets to the US\r\n\r\nBack in 2000 he was a co-owner of the then company that owned meat substitute brand Quorn.\r\n\r\nAt the time the product was primarily bought in the UK as a substitute for beef mince, and made by users into dishes such as spaghetti Bolognese or chilli.\r\n\r\nSeeking to crack the US market, the plan of Mr Wilson and his colleagues was to instead market Quorn in the US as a chicken substitute, including the introduction of Quorn nuggets.\r\n\r\nMr Wilson moved to New York to take charge of the move, and after the nuggets were picked up by upmarket US supermarket chain Whole Food Market, Quorn has never looked back in the country.\r\n\r\nLengthy research\r\n\r\nToday Mr Wilson still lives in the States, and runs a business called Green Seed Group that helps and advises UK and other foreign food firms that wish to launch in the US.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing that any food business that wants to break into American needs to do is research.\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"And by that I don't mean take a week's holiday in Florida or a weekend in New York, you have to move to the US and absorb its food culture. You need to visit supermarket after supermarket, and restaurant after restaurant to study the marketplace.\r\n\r\nThis is the 14th story in a series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market.\r\n\r\n\"The sensible thing is then to go to the big food fairs. First just as a visitor, and then buy a stand. You then need to see if you can attract buyers for independent stores first. The likes of Walmart won't even look at you unless you are already showing some sales success in the US.\r\n\r\n\"And hire a US-based expert to help you find potential buyers, and guide you on labelling laws etc.\r\n\r\n\"The one thing that is much easier and cheaper these days is marketing. Back in my Quorn days it could be expensive, but now firms have social media.\"\r\n\r\nUK organic tea and herbal supplements firm Pukka Herbs also recommends that fellow British food firms attend trade fairs - both in the US and elsewhere overseas - so that they can meet potential buyers.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Pukka Herbs Image caption The team at Pukka Herbs recommend that UK food firms attend trade fairs in the US\r\n\r\n\"We met our first overseas buyer at a trade show in Germany, and then we went to trade shows in the US in 2009 to show off or teas, and we got picked up by a wholesaler in the north east of the country,\" says Pukka Herbs co-founder Tim Westwell.\r\n\r\nThe company was first founded in 2001 and the US market now accounts for 10% of its turnover.\r\n\r\nBritish ex-pat Tracy Claros founded her business, the Sticky Toffee Company, in Austin, Texas, in 2003. Today her company has annual revenues of $4m (\u00a33m), and her stockists include Whole Foods Market, Costco and Walmart.\r\n\r\nHer advice is offer something new, and be patient.\r\n\r\n\"Come with a unique, well-branded product, and be prepared to be here for the long haul,\" she says.\r\n\r\nUK beer firm Brewdog is one company taking this long-term approach in the US, so much so that it has built a brewery in Ohio to make its presence permanent.\r\n\r\nImage caption Tracy Claros has introduced Americans to the joy of sticky toffee pudding\r\n\r\nMr Wilson from Green Seed Group adds: \"Cracking America starts with having a unique brand offer that fits in with the American lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\"It is all about a good market strategy, sound financial backing, and quite a bit of patience.

Titanosaurs are famous as some of the largest land animals on Earth.\r\n\r\nMansourasaurus, however, was relatively small for a titanosaur, and about the weight of an African bull elephant.\r\n\r\nIts skeleton is important in being the most complete dinosaur specimen so far discovered from the end of the Cretaceous in Africa. Parts of the skull, the lower jaw, neck and back vertebrae, ribs, most of the shoulder and forelimb, part of the hind foot, and pieces of dermal plates are preserved.\r\n\r\nRather than being a piece of a jigsaw filling in the gaps in dinosaur history, it is more like \"a corner piece\", said Dr Gorscak. \"It's like finding an edge piece that you use to help figure out what the picture is, that you can build from.\"\r\n\r\nDr Veronica Diez Diaz, an expert in sauropod dinosaurs from the Museum fur Naturkunde in Berlin, who is not connected with the study, said sauropod remains have previously been found in Tanzania and Madagascar.\r\n\r\n\"The important thing about this discovery is that we did not know any Late Cretaceous sauropod species from North Africa,\" she said. \"Most of the remains were teeth and isolated bones. Thanks to Mansourasaurus that is not the case anymore.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on the study, Dr Philip Mannion of Imperial College, London, said, \"This is just the tip of the iceberg - it points to the fact that Africa has the potential to reveal a much richer fossil record.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Dr Michael D'Emic, Adelphi University, added: \"It's just an incredible discovery.

The actor Jon Culshaw has moved beyond the comedy impressions he specialises in to create a portrait of the artist in his final weeks in the place he loved so much - a recording studio.\r\n\r\nIt may seem surprising, but until David Morley wrote his play The Final Take: Bowie in the Studio no one seems to have portrayed Bowie at length in a drama.\r\n\r\nThere had been countless brief impersonations in adverts and comedy sketches on radio and TV. Some of those were by Culshaw, of Dead Ringers fame, who's now taking the central role in The Final Take.\r\n\r\nIt's a semi-monologue, the other main role being Bowie's friend and producer Tony Visconti (played by American actor Martin T Sherman).\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jon Culshaw did a lot of research to play the role of David Bowie\r\n\r\n\"But of course doing a quick 45-second gag is totally different from a considered play about David's last weeks,\" says Culshaw. \"And I'm happy to acknowledge the great Bowie impersonator for comic effect has always been Phil Cornwell who used to do him so brilliantly on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on Radio 2. But this play isn't about getting laughs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Final Take was recorded late last year in a studio in London, with Dirk Maggs directing. Culshaw says it took a while to find the right performance.\r\n\r\nDavid Bowie dies of cancer aged 69\r\n\r\nObituary: David Bowie\r\n\r\nSix decades of David Bowie\r\n\r\nDavid Bowie: A life in pictures\r\n\r\n\"I play David when he's in The Magic Shop recording studio in New York, so at first we tried to tape everything with the lights low for a laid-back, jazz club feel and me sitting down. But it didn't work: it sounded stilted. I needed to stand up and move around a bit even if the listener won't really get that.\r\n\r\n\"The play is half what's going on in David's head and half his conversation with Tony Visconti. They were long-standing colleagues and real friends so Tony is deeply worried when David tells him he has cancer. Overall about 80% of what's in the script comes from what David wrote or said in interviews.\"\r\n\r\nCulshaw researched the role by going through those interviews. They were \"invigorating,\" he says.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption David Bowie's final album, Blackstar\r\n\r\n\"He has such a fantastic personality. However sad it was, I enjoyed studying what he said and figuring out how his brain worked. He was a wonderfully generous interviewee,\" explains Culshaw.\r\n\r\nAnd, above all, he says the accent he adopted had to be just right.\r\n\r\n\"David had started with a South London accent but it was definitely from out in the suburbs - and of course he'd spent much of the second half of his life in the States. A comic take on Bowie's voice could be wildly exaggerated but if anything we underplayed.\"\r\n\r\nBut also vital was respect, for both the music legend - and his family.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Gavin Evans Image caption David Bowie: Gave Jon Culshaw a rule \"to live and create by\"\r\n\r\n\"At one point in the script I was going to do a little acappella singing of a bit of Lazarus from the Blackstar album. But that was the one thing the Bowie estate asked us not to do,\" says Culshaw.\r\n\r\n\"We show that David knows he has cancer but is resolute that it won't dim his energy or destroy his creativity. It's the core of the play and I think we all found it haunting. Even at the end he's at the top of his game.\"\r\n\r\nCulshaw says everyone involved thought of David Morley's play as a tribute to Bowie. \"I'm delighted to be giving a performance that's not broadly comic but I was a little nervous at first about catching David's humanity,\" he adds.\r\n\r\nBut, Culshaw concludes, one interview in particular \"gave me courage\".\r\n\r\n\"David said if you're feeling totally comfortable in the work you're doing then maybe you're not doing the right thing. He said always go a little bit further into the water than you feel you should. It was the rule he lived and created by - so I tried to do the same thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe Final Take: Bowie in the Studio is on BBC World Service radio on 30 January 1130-1200 GMT and is available on BBC iPlayer Radio.\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."}, {"id": 99, "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Steven Anderson was deported from Botswana in 2016 after he said homosexuals should be stoned to death\r\n\r\nA controversial US pastor was prevented from boarding a flight to Jamaica after the authorities there decided to deny him entry.\r\n\r\nPastor Steven Anderson, who is based in Arizona, runs the Faithful Word Baptist Church which says that homosexuality is an abomination and should be punishable by death.\r\n\r\nOfficials said his statements were \"not conducive to the current climate\".\r\n\r\nMr Anderson has been barred from South Africa and deported from Botswana.\r\n\r\nThe pastor had planned to travel to Jamaica with his 14-year-old son to carry out \"missionary work\" when he was prevented by airline officials from boarding the plane on Monday.\r\n\r\n\"I had a connecting flight in Atlanta, so as soon as I got to Atlanta, Delta Air Lines told me that they received a notification from Jamaica that I was not going to be allowed to enter,\" Mr Anderson told The Gleaner newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"I was kind of surprised that Jamaica would ban me for my views on homosexuality,\" he added.\r\n\r\nJamaica has laws criminalising gay sex and rights groups have warned that LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people face frequent discrimination.\r\n\r\nBut LGBT rights activists in Jamaica started a petition asking the Jamaican government to ban Mr Anderson and it was signed by more than 38,000 people.\r\n\r\nJay John, who launched the petition, said he was very pleased by the outcome and called it a \"victory\".\r\n\r\n\"His literal interpretation of the Bible regarding killing of gay people should not be echoed in a society like Jamaica,\" Mr John had argued.\r\n\r\nIn September 2016, Mr Anderson was deported from Botswana after he said on a local radio programme that homosexuals should be \"stoned to death\".\r\n\r\nA week earlier, he had been banned from South Africa, and before that, from the UK."}, {"id": 100, "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Indian society should reflect upon its preference for sons, report authors said\r\n\r\nThe desire among parents in India to have sons instead of daughters has created 21 million \"unwanted\" girls, a government report estimates.\r\n\r\nThe finance ministry report found many couples kept on having children until they had a boy.\r\n\r\nAuthors called this a \"subtler form\" of son preference than sex-selective abortions but warned it might lead to fewer resources for girls.\r\n\r\nSon preference was \"a matter for Indian society to reflect upon\", they said.\r\n\r\nThe authors also found that 63 million women were \"missing\" from India's population because the preference for sons led to to sex-selective abortions and more care was given to boys.\r\n\r\nTests to determine a foetus's sex are illegal in India, but they still take place and can lead to sex-selective abortions.\r\n\r\nWhere are India's millions of missing girls?\r\n\r\nSome cultural reasons for son preference were listed, including:\r\n\r\nProperty passing on to sons, not daughters\r\n\r\nFamilies of girls having to pay dowries to see their daughters married\r\n\r\nWomen moving to their husband's house after getting married\r\n\r\nThe cultural preference for male children has even led one newspaper to list scientifically unfounded tips for conceiving boys, including facing west while sleeping, and having sex on certain days of the week.\r\n\r\nThe states most affected by son preference were Punjab and Haryana, while the least-affected was Meghalaya.\r\n\r\nIn Punjab and Haryana states there were 1,200 boys under the age of seven for every 1,000 girls of the same age, the authors of the Economic Survey found."}, {"id": 101, "text": "Video\r\n\r\nA transgender woman who hopes to become a vicar says Christians have accused her of being \"the devil's daughter\".\r\n\r\nYve Taylor was named Keith when she began her bid to become a vicar.\r\n\r\nShe didn't reach the final stages of being selected after revealing she wanted to live as a woman.\r\n\r\nShe said she has not been welcomed at some churches but hopes to fulfil her dream thanks to support from those at Exeter Cathedral.\r\n\r\nYou can see more on this story on Inside Out at 19:30 on BBC 1."}, {"id": 102, "text": "Over the course of his five decade career, Elton John has always impressed with his spectacular live showmanship.

He has led Tuareg uprisings against the Malian government, acted as go-between in securing the release of hostages kidnapped by al-Qaeda, and spent time as a Malian diplomat in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nA little-known figure who rarely speaks to the press, Mr Ghaly's motivation for founding Ansar Dine remains the subject of some debate.\r\n\r\nHe comes from the Ifoghas tribe and the Kidal region of north-eastern Mali. Believed to be now in his mid-fifties, he first came to public attention in the early 1990s as the leader of a Tuareg revolt seeking independence or greater autonomy for the northern region of Mali that they call Azawad.\r\n\r\nMalian state radio referred to him in 1991 as the secretary-general of the Popular Movement of Azawad and head of the delegation negotiating an end to the rebellion with the government. In 1995 Radio France International called him the \"undisputed leader\" of the Tuareg rebels.\r\n\r\nAfter another, short-lived revolt in 2006, Mr Ghaly became head of a movement called the 23 May Democratic Alliance for Change. The following year he was reported to be a member of the Malian High Council of Territorial Collectivities.\r\n\r\nHostage mediator\r\n\r\nIn August 2003 he played the key role in securing the release of 14 mostly German tourists kidnapped by the Algerian Salafi Group for Call and Combat, GSPC, which later became Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). He negotiated further hostage releases in 2008, 2010 and 2011.\r\n\r\nAlthough European governments denied paying ransoms, these kidnappings are believed to have earned GSPC/AQIM tens of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nIyad Ag Ghaly: The story so far 1991-2006: Led various Tuareg revolts, saying northern Mali was being ignored\r\n\r\nThese usually ended with him being given a government post\r\n\r\n2003: Helped negotiate release of German tourists\r\n\r\n2007: Posted in Mali's consulate in Saudi Arabia\r\n\r\n2011: After fall of Gaddafi in Libya, tried to head new rebel group, MNLA\r\n\r\nRejected and formed Islamist Ansar Dine instead\r\n\r\nA US diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks referred to Mr Ghaly as turning up \"like the proverbial bad penny\" whenever there was the prospect of \"a cash transaction\" between the Tuareg and a foreign government.\r\n\r\nBetween late 2007 and early 2010 he held a post at the Malian consulate in Jedda, Saudi Arabia, although at times during this period he was reported as being in Mali and elsewhere negotiating hostage releases.\r\n\r\nSeveral Malian press reports say he left this post after Saudi Arabia declared him persona non grata for having contact with terrorist elements.\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in Libya in mid-2011, Mr Ghaly reportedly sought the leadership of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), newly-formed by returning Tuareg who had served in the Libyan army, but he was rebuffed.\r\n\r\nAn MNLA official told Le Monde in April 2012 that this was because of links with AQIM, but that it was unclear whether this association was \"out of conviction or out of opportunism\".\r\n\r\nOther sources say Mr Ghaly was rejected because of his \"close ties\" with the Malian government, a suspicion which dates back to the rebellion of 1990, when he was seen as having compromised in the course of negotiations.\r\n\r\nMr Ghaly has also faced problems within the Ifoghas tribe.\r\n\r\nAfter reportedly being overlooked during a takeover of leadership of the tribe in 2011, he was then condemned by the tribal chief and religious leaders for his \"personal project\", Ansar Dine.\r\n\r\nThe pro-MNLA website Toumastpress reported that the tribal chief asked Ansar Dine to lay down their arms or leave the region.\r\n\r\nReligious influence\r\n\r\nMr Ghaly's establishment of Ansar Dine could be seen as a response to setbacks he experienced in the internal Tuareg power struggle, but alongside this Tuareg nationalism one can also trace the development of strong religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nImage caption Ansar Dine fighters have destroyed several famous shrines in Timbuktu\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been attracted to the teachings of a Muslim missionary group, Tablighi Jama'at, which is non-political and condemns violence. He also spent some time in 2002 studying at a mosque in Saint Denis in France.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent interactions with GSPC/AQIM and his time in Saudi Arabia may have moved his religious orientation in a more hard-line direction.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 he reportedly told the Ifoghas tribal meeting that he wanted to impose Islamic law on the Tuareg.\r\n\r\nAfter Ansar Dine's seizure of Timbuktu in April 2012, Mr Ghaly made a statement on the local radio in which he announced \"jihad against the opponents of the Sharia\" and \"enmity to the unbelievers and polytheists\".\r\n\r\nHe also called on the local inhabitants to assist Ansar Dine in \"establishing the religion, spreading justice, security and ruling between people with justice, and promoting virtue and preventing of vice\".\r\n\r\nPotential deal-maker\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain his motivation for founding Ansar Dine because reliable, first-hand information about him is scarce, and conspiracy theories abound.\r\n\r\nOne of these theories sees Mr Ghaly and AQIM as tools of the Algerian (and even US) security services. Another considers him a long-term collaborator with the Malian government.\r\n\r\nThe depth of his adherence to the Islamist cause remains to be seen. As the recent experience in Yemen of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has shown, when a jihadist group seeks to hold populated areas it leaves itself open to a concerted military counteroffensive with international support.\r\n\r\nBy adding the Islamist banner to his status among the Tuareg, Mr Ghaly may just be manoeuvring himself into a position from which he can emerge, as in the past, as the deal-maker.\r\n\r\nBBC Monitoring selects and translates news from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

The recipe for hummus b\u2019tahini (as the dish is named; \u2018hummus\u2019 simply means \u2018chickpeas\u2019), consists of chickpeas, tahini, garlic and lemon. Since it\u2019s relatively simple to make, the variations lie more in how it\u2019s served. Should it be it smooth or lumpy, heavier on the tahini or on the chickpeas, crowned with fava beans or more chickpeas or pine nuts or ground beef? And what\u2019s on the side? Chips? Pickles? Hot sauce? Falafel?\r\n\r\nTarawe topped each plate of hummus with a dollop of tahini and a sprinkling of olive oil. \u201cOil is good,\u201d he said, an accidental Middle East metaphor. Hummus is a regional metaphor, too: beloved all over the world, it\u2019s yet another source of tension, yet another question of proprietorship. Who invented the dish? Who can claim it as their own?\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Why you can\u2019t get \u2018Jewish food\u2019 in Israel\r\n\r\n\u2022 The ancient cheese that\u2019s disappearing\r\n\r\n\u2022 The deadly dish people love to eat\r\n\r\nEveryone from the Lebanese to the Turks to the Syrians have tried, but there\u2019s little evidence for any theory. Most of the ingredients have been around for centuries: the chickpea dates back more than 10,000 years in Turkey and is, according to Anissa Helou, Syrian-Lebanese author of several Middle Eastern cookbooks, \u201cone of the earliest legumes ever cultivated.\u201d And tahini, the sesame paste that is vital to hummus b\u2019tahini, is mentioned in 13th-Century Arabic cookbooks. But the combination of ingredients that make up the popular dish is harder to pin down.\r\n\r\nHummus is a regional metaphor: beloved all over the world, it\u2019s yet another source of tension\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a Jewish food,\u201d said chef Tom Kabalo of Raq Hummus in the Israeli-occupied territory of Golan Heights a few days later. \u201cIt was mentioned in our bible 3,500 years ago.\u201d I was in his restaurant eating his Tuesday special. Because it was October, the special was \u2018Halloween hummus\u2019, garnished with shredded pumpkin and black tahini.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s not the only one who told me that hummus is biblical. Kabalo and others are referring to a passage from the Book of Ruth, part of the third and final section of the Hebrew Bible: \u201cCome hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the hometz.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s true that hometz does sound like hummus, there\u2019s also a good reason to believe otherwise: in modern Hebrew, hometz means vinegar. Of course, \u2018dip your bread in vinegar\u2019 would be an odd expression of hospitality, so therein lies the uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard claims that it was first cultivated in northern India or Nepal,\u201d said Oren Rosenfeld, writer and director of Hummus! The Movie. Said Liora Gvion, author of Beyond Hummus and Falafel: Social and Political Aspects of Palestinian Food in Israel, \u201cI think it is an old and stupid debate that is not worth one\u2019s attention.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut for many, the question of where hummus comes from is absolutely a matter of patriotism and identity. The now legendary \u2018Hummus Wars\u2019 began in 2008 when Lebanon accused Israel of cashing in on what they believed should have been Lebanon\u2019s legacy, publicity and money. The president of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists, angry that hummus had come to be known and marketed throughout the west as an Israeli dish, sued Israel for infringement of food-copyright laws. The Lebanese government petitioned the EU to recognise hummus as Lebanese. Both efforts proved ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThe question of where hummus comes from is absolutely a matter of patriotism and identity\r\n\r\nCultural appropriation is a hot topic in the food world (just ask the Peruvians and Chileans who owns pisco, for example), so the hummus debate could have generated an interesting conversation. Instead, the whole thing devolved into the culinary version of a dance-off: in 2009, Fadi Abboud, Lebanese minister of tourism, decided that the way to settle the matter once and for all was for Lebanon to make a plate of hummus so large it would be recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records. The goal was achieved, the record set with a plate of hummus that weighed around 2,000kg. In response, Jawdat Ibrahim, a famous Arab-Israeli hummus joint in Abu Ghosh, Israel, retaliated with hummus served in a satellite dish that had a diameter of 6.5m \u2013 about 4,000kg of hummus. Then the Lebanese counter-attacked with 10,452kg of the dip \u2013 the number of square kilometers of Lebanon. They have held the record since 2010.\r\n\r\n\u201cLebanon\u2019s efforts were interesting, but they can\u2019t be taken seriously,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cHummus is a Middle Eastern food claimed by all and owned by none.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost people who talk about the Hummus Wars hold Rosenfeld\u2019s diplomatic view. But American food historian Charles Perry, president of the Culinary Historians of Southern California and an expert on medieval Arab food, gives Lebanon some credit.\r\n\r\nHummus is a Middle Eastern food claimed by all and owned by none\r\n\r\n\u201cI tend to take the Lebanese claim somewhat seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cBeirut would be my second choice in response to the question of who invented hummus. It stood out as a sophisticated city throughout the Middle Ages, one with a vigorous culinary tradition, and lemons were abundant there.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut Damascus, Syria, strikes him as the more likely candidate. He explained that the traditional way of serving hummus throughout much of the Middle East is in a particular red clay bowl with a raised edge. The hummus is whisked around briskly with a pestle so that it mounds up along that edge. Not only does this present the hummus conveniently for picking up with bread, it proves that the hummus has the proper texture, neither too slack nor too stiff.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe practice of whipping hummus up against the wall of the bowl indicates a sophisticated urban product, not an ancient folk dish. I'm inclined to think hummus was developed for the Turkish rulers in Damascus,\u201d Perry said.\r\n\r\nExplaining his choice, he continued: \u201cNobody can say who invented hummus, or when. Or where, particularly given the eagerness with which people in the Middle East borrow one another\u2019s dishes. But I associate it with Damascus in the 18th Century because it was the largest city with a sophisticated ruling class,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHowever, another popular theory says that hummus is neither biblical nor Lebanese nor Syrian, but Egyptian. \u201cThe earliest recipe I\u2019ve seen for hummus that includes tahini is from an Egyptian cookbook,\u201d said Middle East historian Ari Ariel, who teaches history and international studies at the University of Iowa. Cookbooks from 13th-Century Cairo describe a dish made of cold pureed chickpeas, vinegar, pickled lemon and herbs and spices. Many claim that it\u2019s the hummus we enjoy today. But is it fair to consider those recipes hummus b\u2019tahini if there\u2019s no tahini? No garlic?\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thing you have to bear in mind about historical cookbooks,\u201d Perry said, \u201cis that they tend to record fashionable dishes, and fashionable dishes eventually become unfashionable, so a modern dish that somewhat resembles an ancient one may not have a historical connection.\u201d In response to the Egypt theory, he continued, \u201cHistorically, Egypt has been more likely to adopt Syrian dishes than vice versa.\u201d\r\n\r\nBack at Akramawi, I sat at a communal table where I met Noam Yatsiv, a tour guide from the Israeli port city Haifa, who takes his hummus very seriously. He told me that he eats hummus five times a week and has a dog named Hummus, and that hummus comes from Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll of them?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\nYatsiv shrugged. He told me that it doesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s from. What matters is the way it\u2019s been co-opted and sold commercially in grocery stores in plastic containers. \u201cThat\u2019s not hummus!\u201d he said, tearing a piece of pita. \u201cThere should be a sign on that hummus the way there is on \u2018kosher shrimp\u2019. It should be labelled \u2018fake hummus\u2019. There should be an international law.\u201d\r\n\r\nMost of the people I spoke with couldn\u2019t agree on where hummus comes from, or on the extent to which it matters. Kabalo said that the more important question is, who\u2019s making it the best? (\u201cYou\u2019re looking at him,\u201d he added, spreading his arms.)\r\n\r\nBut the hummus solidarity I found on my travels was the result of a different question. There was common ground among just about everyone I met who slings hummus for a living \u2013 from Tarawe at Akramawi to the Christian Maronite family who run Abu George Hummus in the Old City of Acre, Israel, to the hipsters at Ha Hummus Shel T\u2019china in Jerusalem\u2019s Nachlaot neighbourhood who give their leftover hummus to the homeless each night \u2013 every time I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your secret ingredient?\u201d\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone answered, \u201cLove.\u201d\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

This has now been corrected. Also, This article has been updated to reflect the ongoing conflict between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights."}, {"id": 129, "text": "In a quiet corner of northern Europe there exists a geopolitical anomaly, where many buildings have an international border running right through them. It\u2019s a place where a person might be in the same bed as his or her spouse, but sleep in different countries. A place where people move their front doors for economic advantage.\r\n\r\nThey look like cartographic amoebae\r\n\r\nNot far from the Belgian border, the Netherlands municipality of Baarle-Nassau is home to nearly 30 Belgian enclaves, known collectively as Baarle-Hertog. On the map, they look like cartographic amoebae, some of them with Dutch nuclei inside.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The strange US-Canada border dispute\r\n\r\n\u2022 The village divided by a border\r\n\r\n\u2022 The library straddling two nations\r\n\r\nThis whole confused mess dates to the Middle Ages when parcels of land were divvied up between different local aristocratic families. Baarle-Hertog once belonged to the Duke (hertog is the Dutch word for \u2018duke\u2019) of Brabant, while Baarle-Nassau was the property of the medieval House of Nassau. When Belgium declared independence from the Netherlands in 1831, the two nations were left with an international muddle so complicated that successive regimes were deterred from defining exact jurisdictions. The borders were not actually finalised until 1995, when the last remaining piece of no man\u2019s land was attributed to Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn first impression, it\u2019s not easy to tell the territories apart, as they look no different from any typical red-brick small Dutch town. Around three-quarters of the region\u2019s roughly 9,000 total residents are Dutch passport holders, and the Dutch municipality also has by far the larger share of land (76 sq km compared to 7.5 sq km). But after a while the differences become apparent, albeit with the help of pavement markings \u2013 white crosses with \u2018NL\u2019 on one side and \u2018B\u2019 on the other \u2013 and house numbers which are marked with the appropriate flag.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch properties are more uniform in appearance than their Belgian counterparts, and Dutch pavements are lined with lime trees, their limbs carefully pruned and braided like vines. The Belgian areas tend to be more architecturally diverse.\r\n\r\nIf I had an ear for it, I\u2019d be able to differentiate accents, too, explained Willem van Gool, chairman of the Baarle tourist office (himself a Dutch passport holder, though his mother is Belgian). Although French is taught in the Belgian schools, Dutch is the primary language of both communities.\r\n\r\nHowever, van Gool noted, \u201cWith the Belgians it is more like a dialect, and with the Dutch it is more\u2026 clean.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat, and the less prescriptive approach to residential landscaping on the Belgian side, has led to a tendency on the part of some of the Dutch to look down on their neighbours. \u201cBack in the days when the schools emptied out at the same time, teenagers would fight,\u201d recalled van Gool, but that all stopped in the 1960s when the town\u2019s two mayors (one Dutch and one Belgian) altered the school timings so that they didn\u2019t overlap and combined the youth club to promote positive interactions.\r\n\r\nToday, many residents of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog have dual citizenship and both a Belgian and a Dutch passport. The peaceful interweaving of the two nations has attracted the interest of advisors to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as an example of how two different communities can live harmoniously together.\r\n\r\nSo is all this border obscurity to Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog\u2019s benefit? It certainly attracts tourists, said van Gool. \u201cThe number of shops, hotels and cafes we have would be more suited to a town of 40,000 rather than 9,000. And when the Belgian shops have to close on Sunday, the Dutch don\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe complexities can still prove difficult, however, especially when it comes to infrastructure. Building permits can be particularly tricky, said Leo van Tilburg, mayor of the Belgian municipality, whose town hall is bisected by the border. Because of its location, Belgium had to seek Dutch permission to build part of their mayoral building \u2013 the part delineated by the brightly illuminated border strip running right through the meeting room.\r\n\r\nEverything is a matter of negotiation\r\n\r\nMuch of Tilburg\u2019s time is devoted to sorting out the delivery of services \u2013 education, water, infrastructure \u2013 in co-operation with his Dutch counterpart, Marjon de Hoon. Resurfacing the roads is his particular bugbear, as roads can cross borders several times within a few hundred metres. And then there are issues like the planning of sewage pipes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe road under which the pipe is being installed may be all Belgian, but who pays if the pipework has to be enlarged thanks to Dutch houses nearby? And who pays to service the streetlights, where the pavement is Belgian but the light shines on Dutch windows?\u201d Tilburg said. \u201c[But] if there are 100 problems, 98 of them will turn out to be no problem \u2013 after plenty of discussions, of course.\u201d\r\n\r\nEverything is a matter of negotiation.\r\n\r\nGiven that Belgium\u2019s planning laws are less restrictive than the Netherlands\u2019, there are clear advantages to having a front door in Belgium, as Kees de Hoon (no relation to the Dutch mayor) explained when I met him at his border-straddling apartment block. A Dutch passport-holder living in Baarle-Hertog, Kees wanted to redevelop the original building, but the front door was in the Netherlands and he couldn\u2019t get planning permission from the Dutch town hall. He solved the problem by simply installing a second front door, adjacent to the first but on the other side of the border. So now with two front doors to the building, one of his apartments is Dutch, and the other three are Belgian.\r\n\r\nIt was done on both sides of the border\r\n\r\nKees isn\u2019t the only one who has taken advantage of jurisdictional loopholes; many long-established families and business owners will admit to have benefited in some small way. The most flagrant example is a former bank that was built right on top of the border so paperwork could be moved from one side of the building to the other whenever one nationality\u2019s tax inspectors came calling.\r\n\r\nAlthough loophole-exploiting isn\u2019t as common as it once was, I couldn\u2019t help imagining the glory days of cross-border rule-bending. The cattle that mysteriously changed fields overnight. The shop stock that was acquired in one country and sold in the other without bothering the tax man. \u201cIt is a subject the locals like to talk about,\u201d agreed van Gool, \u201cand it was done on both sides of the border.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the two jurisdictions are without friction. The drinking age in the Netherlands is 18 but Belgians can legally drink beer and wine at 16, so if a Dutch barkeeper refuses to serve a crowd of teenagers, they can just thumb their nose at him and walk across the road. And the many fireworks shops in the Belgian parts of town are a source of irritation to the Dutch authorities. In the Netherlands, the sale and carriage of fireworks is illegal (except for around the New Year). So when I came to the end of my November visit in Baarle-Nassau/Baarle-Hertog, I had to face Dutch police who were scrutinising everyone leaving town.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, in this laboratory of trans-frontier co-operation, there are still a few outstanding issues to be resolved.\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Five hundred kilometres inside the Arctic Circle, it is a raw wilderness of abrupt peninsulas and brooding cliffs at the nerve ends of the world, a place where nature has long had the upper hand. In winter, as if by decree of Odin, roads vanish under deep snows that cut off communities for days. And when polar darkness descends, from mid-November to late January, it is near absolute.\r\n\r\nIt is a raw wilderness at the nerve ends of the world\r\n\r\nBut as you drive along the deserted, snow-crusted road to Hammerfest, population 10,527, past barely-there fishing hamlets and cod trawlers at standstill, you soon learn that one of the world\u2019s northernmost towns has had far worse problems to deal with than temperatures plummeting below zero.\r\n\r\nFor Hammerfest\u2019s history is a luckless narrative of natural disasters, fires, plagues and war, spanning a timeline from Napoleon to the Nazis. And despite being one of the most storied settlements in northern Europe, the town\u2019s acutely modern look might strike you as odd. Look around and it feels different to elsewhere this far north.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 A strange life at the end of the world\r\n\r\n\u2022 Where to drink the world\u2019s purest water\r\n\r\n\u2022 The code that travellers need to learn\r\n\r\nGone are the clapboard houses so characteristic of Norway. So too are the traditional storefronts from this former whaling town. Instead, facing the harbour is the LED-lit Arctic Culture Centre, a floating glass terminal on stilts. In the middle ground \u2013 between the flat Atlantic sky and backdrop of liquefied gas depots \u2013 are modern apartment blocks and a cruise terminal. And above that, on main street Kirkegata, is a rocket ship-shaped church, a postmodern homage to Finnmark\u2019s triangular-shaped stockfish racks.\r\n\r\nHow does Hammerfest explain this extraordinary transformation? Ever since the 18th Century, after the first European (and soon after North American) traders arrived in the ancestral homeland of the indigenous Nordic Sea Sami, the town has been destroyed, ripped apart, razed to the ground and effectively wiped from the map time and again. It has been to hell and back, numerous times, and yet keeps coming back \u2013 a phoenix of the far north.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can trace our history back some 10,000 years, but in terms of bricks and mortar we\u2019re an exceptionally young town,\u201d said 75-year-old historian Jens Berg-Hansen, when we met on Kirkegata on a bleary November morning for a walk through Hammerfest\u2019s history. \u201cThere\u2019s a pioneering spirit here \u2013 and that\u2019s the reason people come back. This is a town that engenders self-reliance. We have learnt to pull together.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat originally brought Europeans here was the town\u2019s ice-free harbour, a result of the warm Atlantic Gulf Stream which is uncommon in such northern waters. The combination saw the development of an international hunting effort that stretched to the Arctic Ocean via the Norwegian and Barents Seas, an era when seals, whales and walruses were butchered for meat, skins and oil. As riches returned from the ocean hunting grounds, the town became an open-air factory where blubber was scraped off the cetaceans\u2019 skins to prevent it turning rancid.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey used to say you could smell Hammerfest before you could see it,\u201d said Berg-Hansen, describing the town\u2019s boom years in the early to mid-18th Century, which saw the arrival of Russian, German, French, Dutch and American consulate offices. \u201cIt brought in trade, money and plenty of international visitors. They also said the ladies here were as beautiful as those in Paris because of how they dressed.\u201d The sense of history is tangible: still today the streets are home to a disproportionate number of boutiques and hairdressers.\r\n\r\nSuch good times couldn\u2019t last, however, a history documented at the appropriately named Gjenreisningsmuseet, the Museum of Reconstruction for Finnmark and North Troms (named after two neighbouring regions in Norway\u2019s north).\r\n\r\nThe first blow came when the port \u2013 due to its ice-free harbour and strategic location en route to Russia, the Arctic and the UK \u2013 was overrun during the Napoleonic Wars. In July 1809, the British plundered and looted Hammerfest during a \u00ad\u00adweek-long blockade, leaving the city to starve. Half a century later, a hurricane dismantled the town\u2019s warehouses, before tragedy struck again in 1890 with two-thirds of the harbour\u2019s buildings demolished by a catastrophic bakery fire. Almost unbelievably, considering Hammerfest\u2019s unpredictable weather and inaccessibility, the reconstruction effort led to an extensive modernisation. For example, the next year the town became the first in northern Europe to introduce electric street lights.\r\n\r\nFar worse was to come when the town was occupied following Germany\u2019s invasion of Norway in 1940. Anticipating a huge Russian breakthrough at the Eastern Front four years later, Hitler\u2019s scorched-earth retreat saw the town\u2019s battalion of 1,000 Nazi soldiers leave nothing behind. It was October 1944, and with no shelter, food or supplies, the plan was for the Red Army to starve and freeze to death.\r\n\r\nWithin days, Hammerfest burned. Roads were wiped from the map, telegraph poles were chopped down and communication lines destroyed. The harbour lay ravaged, mines pockmarked the town and the entire population of the surrounding municipality were left homeless. So systematic was the Nazi solution, 10,000 buildings were razed to the ground and the only one left standing was the chapel. Almost unbelievably, the fires raged on for four months, and by the time the locals had fled, Hammerfest had ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nIt has been to hell and back, and yet keeps coming back \u2013 a phoenix of the far north\r\n\r\nWith such far-reaching consequences, families were evacuated to southern Norway, including that of 84-year-old Randi Simonsen, one of the town\u2019s oldest surviving eye-witnesses, who I\u2019d earlier agreed to meet at the museum.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Germans were so thorough they burned our basements,\u201d said Simonsen, pointing to sepia photographs of the aftermath. \u201cBut people here were smart and hid their possessions, even if they knew they may one day never return.\u201d\r\n\r\nMercifully, the images of reconstruction at the museum are far more powerful than those of Hammerfest\u2019s destruction. One exhibit shows an American-made barbershop stool, hidden under 3ft of soil by its owner to prevent it from being destroyed. Another reveals two plush velvet armchairs, fully intact if a little worn, also dug up during the post-war effort.\r\n\r\nAs Simonsen recalled, her family were given two days to prepare to leave, not knowing when or even if they could ever return. Aged 11, she travelled with her family some 2,000km south to Telemark. \u201cMy father had the sea in his blood, so only days after peace broke out in May 1945 he was one of the first to return, eventually taking a boat from Troms\u00f8 after first travelling north. Nobody thought not to come back.\u201d\r\n\r\nNobody thought not to come back\r\n\r\nIf the challenge of figuring out how to deal with disaster and recovery in the same breath weighed on Hammerfest, it doesn\u2019t show today. The town may have been left to ruin, but within weeks of the repatriation, numerous buildings and houses had been rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had no time to deal with trauma,\u201d Simonsen said, adding that she slept on the chapel floor after her family\u2019s return. \u201cPeople were happy to be home and, anyway, I was a teenager so I was preoccupied with school, fashion and \u2013 of course \u2013 boys.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother eyewitness, 72-year-old retired schoolteacher Gunnar Milch, has another theory about how Hammerfest has learnt to adapt. It\u2019s a happy story, in a way, of triumph over adversity, he told me.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople sometimes have a romanticised view of the past, but it has always been tough in Hammerfest. For us it was a question of community. When people returned after World War II, they recreated their own community after having been separated from it for so long. The lesson is only we will decide our own fate.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs history now shows, Hammerfest takes its place alongside Mostar in Bosnia, Hiroshima in Japan and Dresden in Germany as a town that has been destroyed yet has risen from the ashes with a deep and defiant response. Today, Hammerfest is prospering once more due to the arrival of liquefied gas companies in a boom expected to last decades. Of little surprise to the locals, it\u2019s simply a continuation of how the town has reinvented itself for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what captures Hammerfest\u2019s never-say-die spirit best is the town\u2019s mascot and heraldic crest: the polar bear. It embodies the vitality of the community, but also the town\u2019s uncanny ability to survive for centuries in a far-flung corner, on the top of the globe, despite the worst intentions of men.\r\n\r\nThey could not have hoped for a more enduring symbol.\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Athenians created the first forms of democracy, the plays and philosophy that shaped Western civilisation, and the classical buildings that still dot the Acropolis.\r\n\r\nAmid the ancient ruins, another survivor of the centuries is the Greek concept of philoxenia \u2013 a term that directly translates as \u2018love of strangers\u2019, but which locals define more as a warmth that makes foreigners feel immediately welcomed when they come to the capital city. \u201cThe people can be very hospitable and friendly,\u201d agreed Julian Williams, who moved from London in 2009.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Greek word that can\u2019t be translated\r\n\r\n\u2022 The world\u2019s most welcoming countries\r\n\r\n\u2022 The people descended from Spartans\r\n\r\nThough more than 4.5 million people visit the city every year to delve into its past, Athens has plenty in its present to make it worth staying for the longer term.\r\n\r\nWhy do people love it?\r\n\r\nThe always-on atmosphere of Athens attracts Greeks and expats alike. \u201cAthens is a buzzing city,\u201d said Chrissy Manika, an Athens native and blogger at Travel Passionate. \u201cNo matter when you go out you will see the cafes and bars filled with people having a good time.\u201d She especially likes wandering the city centre neighbourhood of Plaka, on the north-east side of the Acropolis. \u201cWith all the tourists around, it feels like you are on holiday on an island, especially in summer.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith more than 250 days of sunshine annually, that summer can feel endless. \u201cBy my American standards, \u2018summer\u2019 in Athens lasts from late April to late October,\u201d said Mina Agnos, who opened the Athens office of luxury tour company Travelive in 2008. The weather makes it especially easy to get away to nearby islands for weekend getaways. Williams recommends Hydra (35 nautical miles to the south), where cars are prohibited and people get around the island by riding donkeys and mules or leisurely walking its idyllic city streets, which mostly lack street signs. Though long popular with celebrities and artists, the island retains its laid-back lifestyle with plentiful cafes and contained crowds, thanks to the limited number of hotels.\r\n\r\nThe mountains and forest are also within easy reach. \u201cIf you want to break out of the city, you can do so fairly easily and feel like you\u2019re a million miles [away],\u201d Williams said. \u201cOne of my regular places to go is Mount Hymettus [5-6km from the city centre], which is ideal if you have a dog, and is also great for biking.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat's it like to live there?\r\n\r\nDespite living in an ancient city, residents never get sick of the views. \u201cDriving into the city and seeing the Acropolis or the Temple of Zeus takes my breath away,\u201d Agnos said. \u201cAt every turn, there is a beautiful reminder of the ancient past of this city. It is a lovely reminder of our limited time and that we should make the best of it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAmong the antiquities, nearby neighbourhoods give a glimpse into the city\u2019s contemporary culture. Just steps from the Acropolis, Koukaki was recently ranked as the city\u2019s newest cool neighbourhood for its new National Museum of Contemporary Art, trendy restaurants and cosy cafes. For a more avant-garde feel, Williams recommends the neighbourhood of Exarcheia, 1km north-east of the city centre. \u201cIt has a complex history and culture of student politicisation, anarchism, communism and alternative counter-culture,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nLocals also have their own secrets that tourists often miss while they\u2019re museum-hopping. \u201cSome of the best food is to be had in the local central market in downtown Athens,\u201d said Katilena Alpe, who moved from London nine years ago. \u201cAnd not many know that Athens has a wine route and the vineyards around the capital produce some great wines.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat else do I need to know?\r\n\r\nAs one of the countries hit hardest by the decade\u2019s economic strife, Greece is still a hard place to find a job, and unemployment in Athens remains high. Locals lament the time-consuming and inefficient government bureaucracy, which can cause challenges for newcomers trying to get or start a job.\r\n\r\n\u201cTax paperwork and Greek bureaucracy requires translation so it\u2019s valuable having a friend who can help you navigate the bureaucratic maze to get setup,\u201d Williams said.\r\n\r\nAnd while salaries are lower here in general, Athens has one of Europe\u2019s lowest costs of living, with expenses averaging nearly 50% less than London, according to price compare site Expatistan.com.\r\n\r\nExpats also appreciate that most Athenians speak very good English \u2013 though attempting a little Greek goes a long way. \u201cEven if you are horrible at it, the effort is really appreciated,\u201d Agnos said.\r\n\r\nEven with its challenges, locals recommend never losing sight of the awe of Athens. \u201cI find that the happiest expats are the ones that act like tourists,\u201d said Agnos. \u201cThey are visiting museums or hopping ferries to islands on the weekends, sampling lots of local dining spots, and getting to know the locals.\u201d\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

In the village of Masouleh, nestled deep in northern Iran\u2019s Alborz Mountains, every view is a rooftop view.\r\n\r\nMasouleh was built partway up a steep mountainside to keep the village safe from floods in the valley below and protect it from frigid winds that whip the summit above. But to conform to the steep incline caused by a 100m elevation change, residents had to find creative ways of optimising space. Indeed, the architecture of this roughly 1,000-year-old village is such that the front garden of each house \u2013 as well as restaurants, outdoor cafes and even parts of a bazaar \u2013 sits on the rooftop of the house below it.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 A 10,000-year-old cave village\r\n\r\n\u2022 Spain\u2019s medieval clifftop skyscrapers\r\n\r\n\u2022 Where houses are made out of diamonds\r\n\r\nFor centuries, the roofs of these houses, constructed from clay, stone and wood, have had to not only endure the wet climate (the region sees around 150cm of rain and snow each year), but also the weight of constant foot traffic \u2013 women hanging clothes to dry and merchants selling colourful scarves and handmade dolls from small stands along the alleyways. The guesthouse where I was staying, like many other homes in Masouleh, had a large window that spanned the front wall of the room to let in sunlight and warmth \u2013 one of the traditional techniques to contend with cold winters. (Many of the older Masouleh homes also have a winter room at the back of the building, insulated by the thick, clay walls.)\r\n\r\nWith a cup of tea in hand, I peered down into the slender passageways formed by the interconnected rooftops. I spotted a man carrying groceries from the bazaar up a winding staircase between two houses to his house in the upper levels.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne never gets tired of this view,\u201d my host, Mr Safayee, said as he joined me by the window.\r\n\r\nEvery view is a rooftop view\r\n\r\nMasouleh has long been a trading hub; for centuries, people came from all around the region to sell their wares. And in the early 20th Century, the village was used as a stronghold by the Jangali Movement, which opposed the occupation of Iran by Ottoman, British and Russian forces. But while we sipped our tea, Mr Safayee lamented the gradual emigration of villagers to Iran\u2019s more urban areas.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, there used to be an elementary school here. We never had a large population, but we were all very close,\u201d he told me. \u201cNow, young people leave the village to other cities for work. Now we don\u2019t even have the elementary school.\u201d\r\n\r\nThose who remain have profited from tourism. \u201cIt allowed us to have a good living, and to repair our old houses to the way they were,\u201d Mr Safayee said.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of Masouleh as a popular tourism destination in Iran, the narrow streets can sometimes feel more reminiscent of a large city than a tranquil village. With the larger hotels located at the lower levels near the village entrance, many tourists seem content to stay near the bazaar, which is surrounded by rooftop cafes and restaurants. However, the higher levels tend to be more tranquil.\r\n\r\nI finished my tea and set out to explore Masouleh. As I made my way up towards the top of the village, I glanced down to the valley, where a tour bus was slowly making its way up the inclined road to the base of the village, the point at which visitors would have to walk, as Masouleh\u2019s alleyways do not support vehicle traffic.\r\n\r\nAway from the crowds, I walked along the Barf-Andaz area, meaning \u2018place to throw snow\u2019. \u201cHere in Masouleh, we shovel our snow onto the rooftop of the neighbour below us,\u201d Mr Safayee had told me earlier that day, chuckling at my surprise. Because it is closest to the slope of the mountain, the 1-2m area at the back of each roof is the strongest part of the structure. This is where the shovelled snow is stored in the winter, thus minimising the chance of a roof collapse.\r\n\r\nI made my way back down into the village towards the bazaar, a compact alley filled with shops selling handcrafted knives, mountain goat horns and an assortment of bracelets. Tourists perused the wares while locals went about their evening grocery shopping, stopping at vendors offering baked goods, dried fruit, homemade jam and mountain herbs such as chamomile and mint. I passed an elderly lady, who was winding yarn into the shape of a doll to add to the colourful bundle next to her.\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you like a doll?\u201d she asked as her fingers expertly twisted the yarn to form the shape of a head. She told me that after her daughters had moved to the city of Rasht 70km away, she now makes the dolls that she once made for her daughters for visitors. I politely declined, and she bid me farewell.\r\n\r\nI followed a stairway to the level above the bazaar, took a seat at a restaurant patio and ordered mirzah ghasemi, a flavourful Persian dish of squash, aubergine, garlic and egg served together like a stew. Here, I enjoyed an early dinner while the evening fog rolled in once more, permeating the streets and shrouding the village in mist.\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

It was what many Argentines refer to as a \u2018casa chorizo\u2019 \u2013 so named because the rooms of the house are lined up in a row like a string of sausages, opening onto a series of side patios. Eckstein knew the house would need a lot of work; the walls were crumbling and the ground floor was covered in debris.\r\n\r\nNot long after Eckstein began to renovate, he noticed something unusual about the foundation of the house, and it wasn\u2019t long before one of the patios was sinking. It turned out that Eckstein had stumbled onto what would become one of the city\u2019s most important archaeological sites: a portal to an underground labyrinth.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 An ancient world concealed underground\r\n\r\n\u2022 Chicago\u2019s underground city that\u2019s becoming a design star\r\n\r\n\u2022 The cakes beloved by anarchists\r\n\r\nThe idea of a mysterious underground world has long been a subject of interest and imagination in Buenos Aires. \u201cThe old myths about the existence of a great swarm of tunnels under the city come back to life again and again,\u201d said Ricardo Orsini, coordinator at the city\u2019s Interpretive Centre for Archaeology and Palaeontology.\r\n\r\nAfter Eckstein discovered the sinking patio, a team of archaeologists from the University of Buenos Aires investigated the building\u2019s foundation to learn more about its history. The 20-room mansion had been abandoned in the late 1800s when its occupants fled from the deathly waves of yellow fever sweeping through the Argentine city. In the early 20th Century, the mansion served as tenement housing, but by the 1980s, it was abandoned once again.\r\n\r\nThe decision to dig marked a dramatic change in our local concept of recovering the past\r\n\r\n\"The decision to dig under the whole building marked a dramatic change in our local concept of recovering the past,\" Eckstein said, \"because it revealed not only the past that appears on the surface, but the past that existed under all the buildings.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the house, the archaeological team discovered an unusual vaulted construction, which further excavations revealed as the roof of an underground tunnel. But a tunnel leading to where? And for what purpose? These were the questions the archaeologists explored as they uncovered almost 2km of subterranean passageways. Their research revealed that the old house sat on top of an intricate drainage system. It seemed that neighbourhood residents built the tunnels around 1780 to reroute a stream that caused flooding when it rained, bringing a flow of dirty water \u2013 including animal waste from farms on the outskirts of town \u2013 onto the city streets.\r\n\r\nToday, the mansion \u2013 now the El Zanj\u00f3n de Granados museum \u2013 acts as the entryway to the refurbished tunnels while also housing exhibitions that showcase objects found during the excavation. Standing inside one of the tunnels, I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that these broad passageways were used for such a practical purpose. They\u2019re eerily romantic; lined with exposed brick, they\u2019ve been beautifully restored and illuminated.\r\n\r\nWhile the discovery of the tunnels was a surprise to Eckstein, it wasn\u2019t news for some of San Telmo\u2019s older residents. Several of his neighbours remembered when segments of the dried-out tunnels were still open; no-one seems to know when and why they were closed off.\r\n\r\nUntil relatively recently, confirms Daniel Sch\u00e1velzon \u2013 who led the excavation at El Zanj\u00f3n de Granados and is now the founder and director of the city\u2019s Centre for Urban Archaeology \u2013 any knowledge about the city\u2019s underground passages was based on memory and word of mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cSince I was a student, I was interested in the underground world,\u201d Sch\u00e1velzon told me. \u201cBut everything I heard or read didn\u2019t make sense. It was all myth and fantasy. Nobody was doing serious work. Later, when I was working in the field of urban archaeology, I myself became seriously involved in the subject. And I found underground constructions of all kinds. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\r\n\r\nFounded in 1536, San Telmo is the oldest part of the original settlement of Buenos Aires, and it\u2019s here that many of the city\u2019s underground tunnels are concentrated. But not all the tunnels were built for plumbing purposes. More than a century before the residents of San Telmo rerouted a stream, Jesuit priests were busy at work on another set of tunnels.\r\n\r\nIn the late 16th Century, a Jesuit order from Spain settled in Buenos Aires with the intention of spreading Christianity to the New World. They established a mission consisting of a church, a museum, a library and even a pharmacy \u2013 a complex known today as the Manzana de las Luces (Block of Enlightenment).\r\n\r\nBut the Jesuits weren\u2019t exactly welcome in their new home \u2013 the region\u2019s indigenous populations strongly resisted the priests\u2019 attempts to convert them to Christianity. As conflict brewed, the Jesuits took steps to ensure their safety.\r\n\r\nIt was meant to be a secret\r\n\r\nAccording to Sch\u00e1velzon\u2019s research, the tunnels beneath the Manzana de las Luces were likely one part of a much larger (and unfinished) plan to connect the city\u2019s churches to allow priests and their congregations to escape in the event of an attack. \u201cIt was a defensive project,\u201d Sch\u00e1velzon explained, \u201csimilar to what we\u2019ve seen in Lima [Peru] and in other cities in which there\u2019s no fort, no walls or cliffs. In case of an attack, the only way out is an underground escape.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven the experts don\u2019t know the extent of the Jesuits\u2019 network. In 1767, after failing to convert the indigenous population, the Jesuits abandoned their mission in Buenos Aires, heading inland to establish other missions near the border of Paraguay. The Spanish colonists who remained repurposed the mission buildings for their own use, establishing the Royal College of San Carlos and Argentina\u2019s first national library in their place (both establishments are no longer here). And the Jesuits didn\u2019t leave behind blueprints. \u201cThere is very little written documentation,\u201d Sch\u00e1velzon told me. \u201cIt was meant to be a secret.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit tunnels remained hidden for nearly 150 years, until 1912, when, amid renovations for an architectural school that was operating inside the Manzana de las Luces complex, the floor started collapsing beneath workers\u2019 feet.\r\n\r\nA small section of the tunnel is accessible to the public on a guided tour. In comparison to the spacious tunnels beneath El Zanj\u00f3n de Granados, the narrow, stone Jesuit tunnels feel rudimentary. Visitors walk single file through the dimly lit passageway, stooping to avoid bumping their heads on the low-arching ceilings.\r\n\r\nThe losses we\u2019ve suffered are irreversible\r\n\r\nWhile some experts believe the passageways beneath El Zanj\u00f3n de Granados and Manzana de las Luces were once a part of a more extensive tunnel system, the theory is hard to prove. If a larger network existed, much of it has been lost to time. In recent decades, construction crews working on unrelated projects, like the expansion of the subway, have uncovered, and bulldozed through, subterranean structures that could have been part of that larger network.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Orsini said, \u201carchaeology did not always arrive in time to study all these architectural structures built underground. This is a metropolis in permanent development, and for a long time we lacked a legal framework to protect and preserve our archaeological heritage.\u201d A remedial law passed in 2003 helped, \u201cbut the losses we\u2019ve suffered are irreversible,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nThe mysteries surrounding the tunnels continue to fascinate the public, and stories of undiscovered tunnels still pop up in the news from time to time: in 2000, long-time professors at Fernando Fader Technical School, located in the Flores neighbourhood 9km west of the Manzana de las Luces, recalled an old tunnel that once connected the building\u2019s basement to the nearby Flores train station. An archaeological team found an underground chamber, but no tunnel. Yet to this day, the professors insist that it existed.\r\n\r\nArchaeology is the study of human history. But human recollection is part of the record, too. When the tunnels beneath El Zanj\u00f3n de Granados were discovered, an elderly neighbour named Anastasio expressed delight, but not surprise. He said he always knew about the tunnels: he used to play in them as a child.\r\n\r\n\u201cPor fin los encontraron!\u201d (\u201cThey finally found them!\u201d) he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

Strange tubular shapes glowed in the treetops, catching the pale golden light.\r\n\r\nWedged between branches, they looked like elongated wine barrels or giant cocoons.\r\n\r\nI was en route to witness a unique honey harvest in the forest. Here, on the southern slopes of Bale Mountains National Park in south-east Ethiopia, hand-carved beehives are placed high in the tree canopies. Reaching them to retrieve the sweet, sticky nectar is arduous \u2013 and often dangerous.\r\n\r\nLocal guide Ziyad and I followed beekeeper Said over a flower-strewn meadow before being swallowed into a tangle of trees.\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested in:\r\n\r\n\u2022 The real-life garden of Eden?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mongolia\u2019s surprising snack food\r\n\r\n\u2022 The seafood that fetches \u20ac100 a dish\r\n\r\nThe Harenna Forest is straight out of a children\u2019s storybook. Giant heather and fig trees, elegantly clothed in emerald moss, stretch out their branches as though frozen mid-dance. Black-maned lions roam the area, which is also home to olive baboons, warthogs and endangered Bale monkeys. On our walk, a white-cheeked turaco fixed us with its orange-rimmed eye, striking against pickle-green plumage.\r\n\r\nSaid began preparations, gathering handfuls of moss and lichen, wrapping the bundle with twine and lighting it to create a glowing bouquet for smoking out the bees.\r\n\r\nA curious colobus monkey watched nearby as Said scaled the Hagenia abyssinica, a native tree whose sturdy branches and vast, umbrella-shaped crown provides a secure, sheltered home for the hives. He was barefoot and equipped with a single rope \u2013 a luxury not all local beekeepers can afford.\r\n\r\nHe shimmied up a few metres at a time, pausing every few minutes to loop the rope higher up the broad trunk. The hive was around 20m above the ground. Finally, straddling a branch, he inched towards it and blew smoke from his mossy torch into a tiny hole in the hive, releasing a flurry of glowing embers into the air.\r\n\r\nSaid is one of a handful of beekeepers to still use this ancient method of beekeeping. While other parts of Ethiopia are moving to more modern production, the 600 families of the Harenna Forest are reluctant to abandon techniques honed over generations.\r\n\r\nTheir hives are made from the hollowed-out trunks of dead trees, carved in two canoe shapes and woven together with strips of bamboo. Before being suspended in the treetops, they are smoked over a fire stoked with beeswax and moss, infusing them with an aroma that attracts the queen.\r\n\r\nTiming is everything\r\n\r\nIt takes three days to make a hive, and two people to winch it high in the trees. Once there, each can last up to eight years, yielding around 5kg of honey each biannual harvest, usually June and December.\r\n\r\nAfter smoking out the swarm, beekeepers reach inside to retrieve the combs, squeezing the golden liquid into toughened leather pouches.\r\n\r\nTiming is everything.\r\n\r\nMinutes after reaching the hive, Said released a sharp yelp. Within seconds, he\u2019d slithered down the trunk and was back on the ground. It was too early. A relatively cool summer had delayed hatching, and baby bees \u2013 or ichs \u2013 were still curled in the honeycombs. The nibi, or adult bees, were angry. They continued attacking as Said stumbled away from the tree, shielding his face with a gossamer-thin scarf.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeekeepers often can\u2019t collect [the honey], and then they have to wait for the right moment to go back up,\u201d Ziyad explained patiently, painstakingly plucking bees from Said\u2019s hair and clothes.\r\n\r\nStings might be common, Said added, but this time he\u2019d been assailed by \u201cmore than 100 bees\u201d. This had happened just twice in his 10 years as a beekeeper.\r\n\r\nWith 70 hives clustered in this spot of the forest, Said comes from a line of beekeepers stretching back more than a century. Honey is the second biggest source of income after coffee, which grows wild here. They sell tubs of honey at local markets, keeping some for tej, a mead brewed with freshly harvested honey, water and gesho, a native species of buckthorn used to balance the sweetness with subtle, earthy spices. Every family has its own recipe, bringing out gourds of the wine on special occasions. No celebration is complete without tej.\r\n\r\nLeaving a forlorn Said by his hut, we trekked back to Bale Mountain Lodge, whose thatched chalets are dotted about the Katcha clearing, overlooked by Mount Gujuralli.\r\n\r\n\u201cGenerations have been making honey like that,\u201d Guy Levene, who co-owns the lodge with wife Yvonne, told me. The lodge organises tours to see the honey harvest and is keen to help the Harenna beekeepers earn more money from their craft.\r\n\r\nLevene has even been looking into ways to sell the delicately flavoured syrup abroad, while Slow Food Foundation \u2013 an offshoot of Italy\u2019s Slow Food Movement \u2013 works with beekeepers in pockets of Ethiopia to help increase production, providing bigger, grounded hives and modern machinery to extract honey from the comb.\r\n\r\nHere in Harenna, however, beekeepers are reluctant to abandon generations of tradition, no matter how labour intensive, and hazardous, it might be.\r\n\r\nThere is method in the madness. Placing the intricate hives high atop trees increases the bees\u2019 chances of finding them as they zigzag through the forest. The height also creates distance from creatures that might disturb the hives and snaffle the contents, such as snuffling honey badgers. A few trees wear scraps of metal, like armour, for extra protection from tree-climbing bandits.\r\n\r\nHoney trickles through centuries of culture and religion\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not just about practicality, or even profit. In Ethiopia, honey trickles through centuries of culture and religion. It features in 4th-Century Christian frescoes and tapestries, where saints are seen clutching bereles, the traditional fat-bottomed flasks used for serving tej. Lalibela, the town 1,100km north of the Bale Mountains that\u2019s famous for its 13th-Century monolithic churches, even translates as \u2018honey eater\u2019. It\u2019s named after King Lalibela who, according to legend, was swarmed by bees as a newborn, miraculously emerging unscathed. His mother named him Lalibela, declaring the bees had recognised him as a ruler.\r\n\r\nHoney here is healing, even spiritual. Folklore says that bees constructed hives \u2013 chewing wax until soft, then bonding it to create honeycomb cells \u2013 in the windows of Lalibela\u2019s earliest churches before the first congregation in 488AD. They still produce \u2018holy honey\u2019 or mar, reserved only for healing \u2013 applied topically to treat skin diseases or, for internal illnesses, eaten by the spoonful or imbibed with holy water.\r\n\r\nIn the Bale Mountains, honey is both part of everyday life and a symbol of social status. Families with larger numbers of beehives and a higher yield of honey are held in high regard. Ownership is sacred, and theft of other beekeepers\u2019 honey or hives is rare: if caught, the culprit is shunned by his neighbours.\r\n\r\nSpoonfuls are taken in the morning, the antibiotic properties believed to ward off illness and soothe the soul. Bees pollinate up to 20 different plants, resulting in a complex, perfumed honey. Nectar gathered from Hagenia trees, whose dusky pink blooms are brewed into a tea to treat tapeworm, adds medicinal value.\r\n\r\nThe day after the harvest, guide Ziyad took me to his village, Rira, a brief but bumpy drive along pot-holed paths.\r\n\r\nSlow Food Foundation formed a beekeepers\u2019 cooperative here in 2014, aiming to refine the honey collection and packaging process so a more sophisticated product can be brought to market. It\u2019s a slow process. As in the Harenna Forest, Rira\u2019s beekeepers are attached to traditional methods. Many families have hung their hives in the same trees for several generations. For now, the priority is providing and encouraging the use of protective clothing and equipment, to at least minimise the risk of injury.\r\n\r\nIn the tiny village, we sat on plastic chairs surrounded by teardrop-shaped huts cladded with mud and woven with straw, as plates appeared from a tiny kitchen.\r\n\r\nFinally, I got to taste the dark amber honey \u2013 creamy, fruity and floral, with a whisper of smoke \u2013 mopped up with ambasha flatbread. Groups of children sat nearby, devouring the same.\r\n\r\nHoney and bread is a regular after-school snack, Ziyad explained. Leftover bread is chopped up and mixed with more honey, then eaten in bowlfuls for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been that way,\u201d he said. \u201cHoney with everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"If You Only Read 6 Things This Week\".

After both sessions, blood tests and other physical tests are carried out.\r\n\r\nParticipants are vetted and informed they will be inhaling pollution at that level, and sign consent forms to that effect. They are paid about $14 (\u00a310) an hour. The tests require a raft of approvals from public health bodies.\r\n\r\nSuch studies are \"essential to back up policies that protect all of us\", said Dr Christopher Carlsten, a professor at the University of British Columbia who has conducted emissions testing on humans.\r\n\r\n\"There do seem to be individuals who are frustrated that this work is done at all. I would ask them to look at the evidence that these studies, when appropriately done, contribute significantly to the evidence that leads to regulations that protect the public from adverse air quality,\" he said.\r\n\r\nOne unusual aspect of the VW testing, according to both Dr Kelly and Dr Carlsten, was the use of monkeys. According to the New York Times, 10 cynomolgus macaque monkeys, a breed used extensively in medical experiments, were put in chambers and played cartoons to distract them while diesel fumes were pumped in.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A Tonkean macaque takes part in a scientific experiment in eastern France\r\n\r\n\"It's uncommon to study non-human primates, I never conducted animal research\" said Dr Carlsten. \"I would speculate that human testing is more common simply because we learn more from the full human organism. That is what we are trying to protect.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was the funding and commissioning of tests by the motor industry itself that was the significant controversy, both professors said. The work was commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector, a car lobby group funded by the VW, BMW and Daimler car manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of studies undertaken by Dr Kelly and Dr Carlsten are independently funded, peer-reviewed and published.\r\n\r\n\"In this case we don't know the details of what they did, the actual levels they used, how they controlled the tests,\" said Dr Carlsten. \"These studies have not to my knowledge been published, so it really raises questions about the rigour or their methods.\"\r\n\r\nA good analogy would be allowing tobacco companies to sponsor research on the effects of smoking, keep the results secret, and simply publishing a press release that suited them, said Dr Kelly.\r\n\r\n\"That would not be satisfactory, it would not be independent and, if it involved humans, it would not be ethical,\" he said."}, {"id": 185, "text": "Image copyright AP/Briscoe Center for American History Image caption A series of images by Eddie Adams leading up to the killing of Nguyen Van Lem\r\n\r\nPhotojournalist Eddie Adams captured one of the most famous images of the Vietnam War - the very instant of an execution during the chaos of the Tet Offensive. It would bring him a lifetime of glory, but as James Jeffrey writes, also of sorrow.\r\n\r\nWarning: This story includes Adams' photo of the moment of the shooting, and graphic descriptions of it.\r\n\r\nThe snub-nosed pistol is already recoiling in the man's outstretched arm as the prisoner's face contorts from the force of a bullet entering his skull.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the frame, a watching soldier seems to be grimacing in shock.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to not feel the same repulsion, and guilt, with the knowledge one is looking at the precise moment of death.\r\n\r\nBallistic experts say the picture - which became known as Saigon Execution - shows the microsecond the bullet entered the man's head.\r\n\r\nEddie Adams's photo of Brigadier General Nguyen Ngoc Loan shooting a Viet Cong prisoner is considered one of the most influential images of the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nAt the time, the image was reprinted around the world and came to symbolise for many the brutality and anarchy of the war.\r\n\r\nIt also galvanised growing sentiment in America about the futility of the fight - that the war was unwinnable.\r\n\r\nImage copyright AP/Briscoe Center for American History\r\n\r\n\"There's something in the nature of a still image that deeply affects the viewer and stays with them,\" says Ben Wright, associate director for communications at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History.\r\n\r\nThe centre, based at the University of Texas at Austin, houses Adams's archive of photos, documents and correspondence.\r\n\r\n\"The film footage of the shooting, while ghastly, doesn't evoke the same feelings of urgency and stark tragedy.\"\r\n\r\nBut the photo did not - could not - fully explain the circumstances on the streets of Saigon on 1 February 1968, two days after the forces of the People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong launched the Tet Offensive. Dozens of South Vietnamese cities were caught by surprise.\r\n\r\nHeavy street fighting had pitched Saigon into chaos when South Vietnamese military caught a suspected Viet Cong squad leader, Nguyen Van Lem, at the site of a mass grave of more than 30 civilians.\r\n\r\nAdams began taking photos as Lem was frogmarched through the streets to Loan's jeep.\r\n\r\nLoan stood beside Lem before pointing his pistol at the prisoner's head.\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was going to threaten or terrorise the guy,\" Adams recalled afterwards, \"so I just naturally raised my camera and took the picture.\"\r\n\r\nLem was believed to have murdered the wife and six children of one of Loan's colleagues. The general fired his pistol.\r\n\r\n\"If you hesitate, if you didn't do your duty, the men won't follow you,\" the general said about the suddenness of his actions.\r\n\r\nImage copyright AP/Briscoe Center for American History\r\n\r\nLoan played a crucial role during the first 72 hours of the Tet Offensive, galvanising troops to prevent the fall of Saigon, according to Colonel Tullius Acampora, who worked for two years as the US Army's liaison officer to Loan.\r\n\r\nAdams said his immediate impression was that Loan was a \"cold, callous killer\". But after travelling with him around the country he revised his assessment.\r\n\r\n\"He is a product of modern Vietnam and his time,\" Adams said in a dispatch from Vietnam.\r\n\r\nBy May the following year, the photo had won Adams a Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography.\r\n\r\nBut despite this crowning journalistic achievement and letters of congratulation from fellow Pulitzer winners, President Richard Nixon and even school children across America, the photo would come to haunt Adams.\r\n\r\n\"I was getting money for showing one man killing another,\" Adams said at a later awards ceremony. \"Two lives were destroyed, and I was getting paid for it. I was a hero.\"\r\n\r\nImage copyright Briscoe Center for American History Image caption Eddie Adams (right) holds up his Pulitzer Prize\r\n\r\nAdams and Loan stayed in touch, even becoming friends after the general fled South Vietnam at the end of the war for the United States.\r\n\r\nBut upon Loan's arrival, US Immigration and Nationalization Services wanted to deport him, a move influenced by the photo. They approached Adams to testify against Loan, but Adams instead testified in his favour.\r\n\r\nAdams even appeared on television to explain the circumstances of the photograph.\r\n\r\nCongress eventually lifted the deportation and Loan was allowed to stay, opening a restaurant in a Washington, DC suburb serving hamburgers, pizza and Vietnamese dishes.\r\n\r\nAn old Washington Post newspaper article photo shows an older smiling Loan sitting at the restaurant counter.\r\n\r\nBut he was eventually forced into retirement when publicity about his past soured business. Adams recalled that on his last visit to the restaurant he found abusive graffiti about Loan scrawled in the toilet.\r\n\r\nHal Buell, Adams' photo editor at the AP, says Saigon Execution still holds sway 50 years later because the photo, \"in one frame, symbolises the full war's brutality\".\r\n\r\n\"Like all icons, it summarises what has gone before, captures a current moment and, if we are smart enough, tells us something about the future brutality all wars promise.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Buell says the experience taught Adams about the limits of a single photograph telling a whole story.\r\n\r\n\"Eddie is quoted as saying that photography is a powerful weapon,\" Buell says. \"Photography by its nature is selective. It isolates a single moment, divorcing that moment from the moments before and after that possibly lead to adjusted meaning.\"\r\n\r\nAdams went on to an expansive photography career, winning more than 500 photojournalism awards and photographing high-profile figures including Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro and Malcolm X.\r\n\r\nBut despite all he achieved after Vietnam, the moment of his most famous photograph would always remain with Adams.\r\n\r\n\"Two people died in that photograph,\" Adams wrote following Loan's death from cancer in 1998. \"The general killed the Viet Cong; I killed the general with my camera.\"\r\n\r\n."}, {"id": 186, "text": "Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The four ex-communist countries have agreed a joint stance on any bloc reform\r\n\r\nIt's not long ago that European know-it-alls, like myself, were debating the possibility of EU collapse.\r\n\r\nAfter Brexit could come Nexit, Dexit and Frexit, we thought, as a wave of anti-establishment euroscepticism washed across the continent.\r\n\r\nBut shock at the ongoing political disorder in the UK following the Brexit vote, plus a sense of uncertainty in Europe provoked by the Trump presidency, have served to solidify EU membership in most countries.\r\n\r\nNow the battle is no longer about survival but over the direction the European Union should take.

From 1988 to 2012, the county voted blue.\r\n\r\nMore widely, Michigan was part of the so-called \"blue wall\" of solid Democrat states. And then, in 2016, Donald Trump came along.\r\n\r\nMr Trump's victory in Saginaw County was narrow - he won just 1,074 more votes than Hilary Clinton - but notable.\r\n\r\nCounty by county, brick by brick, the blue wall came down.

No.\r\n\r\n\"But I am an outsider, I am a businessman, I want to put people first.\"\r\n\r\nDr Hines, a Christian, is not put off by the president's crudeness - \"It's not how I would express myself, but I think he speaks from his heart\" - or his tough line on immigration.\r\n\r\n\"To have a sovereign country you need borders,\" he says. \"Immigration - great. But not illegal immigration.\"\r\n\r\nHe supports the wall on the Mexican border, and thinks Mr Trump's policies - especially the tax cuts - have rejuvenated Saginaw.\r\n\r\n\"I think there's a lot of optimism,\" he says. \"There wasn't so much before Trump.

The crew decided to return to their base in Balad, about 30 miles further north, and Duckworth handed control of the Black Hawk helicopter to her co-pilot Dan Milberg.\r\n\r\nDuring the journey, as they flew low over palm trees to avoid detection, she heard the \"tap, tap, tap\" of gunfire against the helicopter.\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward to get the GPS co-ordinates to report where the helicopter had been shot.\r\n\r\n\"Right then, bam, the fireball happened in my lap with an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] going off,\" she told The Axe Files.\r\n\r\n\"It took off most of the back of my right arm because I had that forward.

She did not realise she no longer had feet.\r\n\r\nDan Milberg landed the helicopter and carried Duckworth out. Her crew had assumed she was dead, but by nevertheless moving her quickly from the helicopter to get aid, they saved her life.\r\n\r\nDuckworth woke up about 11 days later, in pain and angry. She had lost both legs and most of the use of her right arm.\r\n\r\nIn later years, she adapted a playful attitude to her amputation - wearing a T-shirt saying \"Dude, where's my leg?\" and addressing the Democratic National Convention with one prosthetic leg painted in camouflage, the other in the American flag.\r\n\r\nIn hospital though, one of her first thoughts was revenge against her attacker. \"I wanted to hunt him down,\" she told The Axe Files.\r\n\r\nIn the end she underwent countless operations and spent 13 months in hospital, much of it at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington DC.\r\n\r\nThe hospital, packed with soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, became what she called \"an amputee petting zoo\" for politicians seeking photo opportunities.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps inevitable that Duckworth had ended up joining the military, even if she had initially resisted, having hoped to join the diplomatic service instead.\r\n\r\nGenerations of her family had served in the military, going as far back as the American Revolution. Her father Frank fought in World War Two and the Vietnam War.\r\n\r\nA fierce patriot, Frank Duckworth was a Marine and served as a signal officer in Vietnam. But he found himself confronted and spat at when he returned to the US in between tours as the movement against the Vietnam War gathered strength.\r\n\r\nHe preferred to stay in south-east Asia in between tours, and met Lamai Sompornpairin, who had grown up sewing hats in a Thai factory and was then working in her parents' grocery shop.\r\n\r\nThe couple, with baby Tammy in tow, stayed in the region after the war while Frank worked for the UN Development Programme and different corporations. Tammy spoke nothing but Thai until she was eight years old.\r\n\r\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Some of Duckworth's earliest memories involve the Khmer Rouge seizing control in Cambodia\r\n\r\nHer experiences with conflict began at a young age, as the Marxist Khmer Rouge regime took power in Cambodia.\r\n\r\nShe has said some of her earliest childhood memories are of being in Phnom Penh, watching bombs going off. She said her parents told her to think of them as fireworks, so she would not be scared.\r\n\r\nThe latter period of her time in Asia, living in Indonesia and Singapore, gave her pride in being American, and in seeing how people abroad viewed her country.\r\n\r\nYet the Duckworths later fell on hard times as Frank Duckworth lost his job. Despite his reluctance to return to a country he felt had rejected him, he had no choice but to go back to the US.\r\n\r\nAt several points, Tammy Duckworth's story echoes that of President Obama, the man who called her \"a tough lady, but with a big heart\" as she ran for his old Senate seat.\r\n\r\nBoth have acknowledged how their mixed-race origins helped form their identities. Both grew up in Indonesia at around the same time, and both left Asia to live in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nWhile Duckworth said the move to a multicultural state like Hawaii was the perfect way for her to assimilate into US life, it was a hard transition for her father.\r\n\r\nThe family depended on food stamps to survive. In 2013, she reflected on her teenage years while speaking in Congress against possible cuts to food stamps. \"They were there for me, so I could worry about school and not about my empty stomach.\"\r\n\r\nOften, Duckworth and her brother Thomas could eat only if their father had found enough coins left in telephone kiosks. When she found work after school, she was the only member of her family to have a job.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Instagram/@senduckworth Image caption Duckworth (second row, first on left) with the National Guard in 1990\r\n\r\nHer father, who died in 2005, went on to find work at a chicken factory, and Duckworth was able through grants and loans to make her way to three universities.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it was her classmates who convinced her that she could achieve her eventual aim of being an ambassador by joining the military first.\r\n\r\n\"What I didn't expect was to fall in love with the camaraderie and sense of purpose that the military instills in you,\" Duckworth wrote in Politico in 2015.\r\n\r\n\"The thing is, when we were exhausted and miserable, my fellow cadets and I were exhausted and miserable together.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the other cadets was her future husband, Bryan Bowlsbey. It wasn't immediately obvious the two were destined for marriage.\r\n\r\n\"He made a comment that I felt was derogatory about the role of women in the Army,\" she told the C-Span news network in 2005, \"but he came over and apologised very nicely and then helped me clean my M16.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be far from the last time Duckworth would face a derogatory comment, but it would be the only time she would marry the man who made it.\r\n\r\nDuckworth's political career took off as her rehabilitation from her injuries was continuing.\r\n\r\nIt was an invitation by Illinois Democrat senator Dick Durbin to attend the 2005 State of the Union address that first ignited her interest.\r\n\r\nDuckworth had already become an unofficial adviser to younger veterans within Walter Reed hospital, leading Mr Durbin to suggest she should consider running for office.\r\n\r\nShe ran as a candidate for Congress in Illinois in 2006, barely two years after the attack in Iraq.\r\n\r\nBut she lost the race to Republican Peter Roskam by only 5,000 votes. \"I sat in a bathtub and cried for three days,\" she said.\r\n\r\nOver the following years, she continued her duties with the National Guard and as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs, where she launched a hotline for suicidal veterans and helped improve access to healthcare payments and work for veterans.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, newly elected President Obama appointed her as an assistant secretary to the federal Department of Veterans' Affairs.\r\n\r\nThen in 2012, she ran for Congress again in another Illinois district - this time against an opponent who openly disparaged her military record.\r\n\r\nJoe Walsh was hardly the most popular candidate when he ran against Duckworth in Illinois' eighth district.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican incumbent was sued by his ex-wife over missed child support payments, and when he shouted at a constituent, his chances became even slimmer.\r\n\r\nThen when he attacked the service carried out by Duckworth, by this point a recipient of the Purple Heart medal for those injured in service, his fate was perhaps sealed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm running against a woman who, my God, that's all she talks about,\" he said at a town hall meeting. \"Our true heroes, it's the last thing in the world they talk about.\"\r\n\r\nDuckworth ended up winning 54.7% of the vote, compared with Walsh's 45.3%.\r\n\r\nShe held on the seat two years later. A month later, at the age of 46 and after several unsuccessful courses of IVF treatment, she gave birth to her first child, Abigail.\r\n\r\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Barack Obama greets Duckworth in 2008 - she would join his government soon after\r\n\r\nDuckworth often reflects back on the day her helicopter was struck, and acknowledges how her time in the military has helped shape the politician she is today.\r\n\r\n\"That day, and so many others when I served, illustrated the two most important lessons the military taught me,\" she wrote in Politico magazine. \"Never leave anyone behind - not on the battlefield and not in our country. And never put a service member in harm's way without understanding the cost.\"\r\n\r\nBut as Duckworth's first race for the Senate was entering its final stretch in October 2016, the Chicago Tribune pointed out that her much-vaunted record on helping veterans had been mixed.\r\n\r\nAfter a decade in public service, the newspaper said, \"several\" of her initiatives to help Illinois veterans \"fell flat\", her post in the federal veterans' affairs body \"mostly focused on public relations\" and her two terms in Congress were \"marked by only a few legislative successes\".\r\n\r\nDuckworth has defended her record, but even one of her headline pieces of policy - a bill she sponsored requiring airports to provide spaces for breastfeeding mothers - has yet to become law.\r\n\r\nAs a senator, her record will now face even more scrutiny. She reached the Senate after another bruising election campaign in 2016, one that saw her opponent Mark Kirk belittle her family's military history.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Tammy Duckworth, next to daughter Abigail, mother Lamai and husband Bryan, is sworn in as a senator by then Vice-President Joe Biden\r\n\r\nShe started her time as a senator optimistically, expressing hope that she and fellow Democrats could work with President Trump.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to start off assuming that he loves this country as much as I love this country,\" she told The Axe Files podcast just before taking office. \"If you start off from that point, I think you can learn to work with anyone.\"\r\n\r\nIt has not worked out that way.\r\n\r\nInstead, Duckworth has positioned herself as one of the most persistent and vocal critics of the president, on issues relating to the military and immigration in particular.\r\n\r\nLast weekend, as Trump attacked Democrats for not helping pass a funding bill that he said was \"holding our military hostage\", Duckworth attacked him from the Senate floor - noting how he had repeatedly avoided service in Vietnam because of a reported bone spur in his foot.\r\n\r\n\"I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong-un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops and millions of innocent civilians in danger.\"\r\n\r\nDuckworth has been especially critical of Trump over North Korea, warning last month that he and the defence community were gearing up for war.\r\n\r\nAmid her criticism of the president, the rumblings of a Tammy Duckworth run for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential race have already started.\r\n\r\nWhile she has not acknowledged any interest in running - at least not yet - Duckworth is surely aware that one significant political 'first' has still not been achieved: the first female president."}, {"id": 193, "text": "Image copyright Benjamin Paul\r\n\r\nIf you could see how the rest of your life might play out would you want to? Jackie Harrison has a 50-50 chance of a disease that has killed her mother, uncle and grandfather. Should she take a test to find out whether she will get it too - and could she cope with the result? The BBC's Sarah Bowen has been following her story.\r\n\r\nIt's rare for a day to pass when Jackie Harrison doesn't wonder if she's inherited the faulty gene that could lead to her developing Huntington's disease, a condition that causes certain nerve cells in the brain to waste away and slowly robs you of the ability to talk, to walk, to move, to think, to swallow.\r\n\r\nThere is no treatment for Huntington's and no cure.\r\n\r\nJackie is 51 and lives in Brighouse, a small, industrial town in West Yorkshire, with her partner of 30 years, Tony, and younger brother, Mark.\r\n\r\nWhen Jackie was 12 her mother, Jean, who'd been a teacher, died from the disease at the age of just 48.\r\n\r\nImage caption Jackie and her brother Mark as children\r\n\r\nHer father left the children to be brought up by their grandmother, 78-year-old Edith, who had already lost her husband to Huntington's.\r\n\r\nWithin two years Edith's son, Barry - Jackie's uncle - had also died.\r\n\r\n\"I've not had a normal life, it's taken everything from me,\" Jackie says. \"I don't know what it's like to have a mum and dad, to have that stability.\"\r\n\r\nImage caption Both Jackie's uncle, Barry, and mother, Jean died as a result of Huntington's\r\n\r\nJackie wanted to become a teacher like her mum and grandmother, but when Edith died it was up to Jackie to run the house and look after her brother.\r\n\r\nFind out more\r\n\r\nJackie Harrison told her story to Sarah Bowen on BBC Radio 4's The Untold\r\n\r\nListen to: The toss of the coin on Monday 22 January at 11:00 GMT\r\n\r\nShe got a job and managed to keep a roof over their heads while Mark took his exams at school. Then, when Mark went to university, Jackie was able to work part-time and study herself - gaining a degree and doing a teaching diploma.\r\n\r\nBut then Mark developed Huntington's and for the past 10 years Jackie has been his full-time carer.\r\n\r\n\"I prepare all his food, do his shopping, do all the cleaning,\" Jackie says. \"As soon as he's got clean clothes on he's dirty straightaway, spills his food down him all the time.\"\r\n\r\nJackie helps Mark with everything, from going to the toilet to organising his finances.\r\n\r\nHaving a parent who had Huntington's means Jackie has a 50-50 chance of developing it herself and the possibility that she will is always there at the back of her mind.\r\n\r\n\"I twitch my shoulder and I know I do it. Sometimes I've got a twitchy eye,\" Jackie says. \"I'm being bad tempered, shouting at people. So you think, 'Is this the start of it?'\"\r\n\r\nImage copyright Benjamin Paul\r\n\r\nBut Jackie's never wanted to take the Huntington's test, whenever she's thought about it she's always backed away, her partner Tony says.\r\n\r\nIt's early December 2016. Jackie has her first appointment with a clinical geneticist at Leeds General Infirmary to discuss the possibility of taking the test.\r\n\r\nShe's not really had much time to think about the idea, what with the stress of looking after Mark and trying to get funding to build an extension for a specially adapted bathroom for him.\r\n\r\nIf you get a positive result you're effectively getting a death sentence. You know exactly how are you going to die\r\n\r\nJackie's also learning to drive - something she's never done before because she knows she'll only have to give it up if she does get Huntington's.\r\n\r\n\"I remember coming back from the seaside once in the car with my uncle and being stopped by the police - they thought he was drunk,\" Jackie says.\r\n\r\n\"Eventually the car was taken off us. So what's the point in going through all this heartache, wasting a year of my life and spending all this money if I do test positive for this bloody disease?\"\r\n\r\nJackie's not even sure that she's really ready to find out if she carries the Huntington's gene.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how far with the process I will go. This might be the end of it today, I don't know,\" she says.\r\n\r\nJackie and the doctor talk through her family history and the pros and cons of taking the test for about an hour.\r\n\r\n\"There's no medical reason to do the test,\" Dr Emma Hobson explains. \"We have to think very carefully about a bad result and the impact of that. You may say that you've always thought you're going to get Huntington's, but the reality of actually being told, 'Yes, you are,' that's quite a big step .\"\r\n\r\nJackie gets upset, she's not sure Christmas is the right time, maybe it's not a good idea to go ahead just now.\r\n\r\n\"It puts a microscope to everything you've lost,\" she says. \"Maybe in the spring.\"\r\n\r\nJackie agrees to return for another meeting in a couple of months.\r\n\r\n\"If you get a positive result you're effectively getting a death sentence. You know exactly how are you going to die, which is a lot of knowledge to take on,\" she says.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that's why there's so much counselling upfront. Would I throw myself under a bus? I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nAs Christmas approaches Jackie is busy looking after Mark and trying to raise the profile of Huntington's disease with an idea inspired by her border terrier, Sybil.\r\n\r\nShe's sewing and sending out hundreds of little green and pink felt dogs to encourage friends, celebrities, anyone, to photograph themselves with one, just to get people to talk about the disease.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Benjamin Paul\r\n\r\n\"I'm not very good at crafts, but I've managed to make six or seven hundred of these,\" Jackie says, \"it's driving me crazy picking up bits of thread and felt.\"\r\n\r\nHuntington's disease\r\n\r\nAbout 8,500 people in the UK have Huntington's disease and a further 25,000 will develop it when they are older\r\n\r\nOnly a very small proportion of people from Huntington's families take the test to find out if they carry the faulty gene\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2017, just after Jackie got her results, researchers announced that the defect that causes Huntington's had been corrected in patients for the first time - they say there is now hope the disease can be slowed or prevented\r\n\r\nSince the announcement more people are coming forward to take the test\r\n\r\nFor as long as she can remember, Jackie's felt that Huntington's has been a hidden disease - as though it were a shameful thing to have in the family.\r\n\r\n\"In America researchers in the '20s thought Huntington's disease families were tainted by witchcraft,\" Jackie says. \"And the language around it is fascinating - it's a devil's disease, or it's a curse.\"\r\n\r\nMany families hide Huntington's, she says, and that feeling of shame passes through generations. She remembers being embarrassed as a child, going out with her own mother.\r\n\r\n\"Mum wanted to go to the Brighouse Gala but then she'd fall over and have a cut leg, and so you're the one with the mother staggering about looking like she's a drunk, not like the other ones,\" Jackie says, fighting back tears.\r\n\r\n\"And you're frightened it'll be you next and nobody will want you because you're going to get the same thing, it just goes on for generations.\"\r\n\r\nBut after Jackie and Mark there won't be any future generations of this family with Huntington's. Mark never had the chance to marry and have kids before the disease took hold, and although Jackie and Tony have been together for more than three decades they've never had children either.\r\n\r\nMore from The Untold\r\n\r\nTony would have liked to have married Jackie but with everything else going on it would just be another thing to organise now. He says it's hard to imagine how different things would have been if there had been no Huntington's in their lives.\r\n\r\n\"I should imagine we probably would have had children - we would have had no reason not to,\" Tony says. \"It's something that I'm sure Jackie regrets.\"\r\n\r\nBut having a family is something Jackie's never really allowed herself to think about too much because she's always believed she carries the faulty gene.\r\n\r\n\"You toy with it, but I think you just put it away because you wouldn't want to inflict this on to anybody else,\" she says.\r\n\r\nIt's a warm, spring day in early May 2017 and Jackie and Tony are back in Leeds, on their way to the next hospital appointment.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the day, it's never going to be the right time. So what do you do? Live without the knowledge? Or crack on and get it done?\" Jackie says.\r\n\r\nImage caption Tony and Jackie at home in Brighouse\r\n\r\nSince her last visit here government funding for the bungalow extension has come through and building work has begun on the accessible wet-room for Mark. Jackie's also passed her driving test.\r\n\r\n\"Every time I get in the car I think, 'This is really bizarre,'\" Jackie says, smiling. \"But it will be useful.\"\r\n\r\nShe's feeling more determined to go ahead with the test and spends an hour talking through the impact that both a positive and negative result might have.\r\n\r\nIf Jackie wants to go ahead with the test she now can.\r\n\r\nFive months later, on Friday 13 October 2017, Jackie is back at Leeds General Infirmary. Emma Hobson explains how she will tell Jackie the results at the next appointment if she goes ahead and has the blood test.\r\n\r\n\"I will make sure your appointment is the first of the afternoon and I will call you in and I will say, 'Hello, I've got your results. I'm really pleased it's good news', or 'I'm really sorry it's not,'\" she says.\r\n\r\n\"We will not be chatting, or passing the time of day, or talking about the weather.\"\r\n\r\nShe goes through the consent form with Jackie and continues to check that this is really is the right thing for her.\r\n\r\nJackie has her blood taken by a nurse. It takes just seconds.\r\n\r\nA month has passed. It has been a long wait.\r\n\r\nJackie and Tony have arranged to get a new dog in the days after Jackie gets her results. Their beloved Sybil passed away in September after more than 14 years with them, and they think that the new puppy, another border terrier they'll call Spike, will help keep their minds off things.\r\n\r\nJackie's been having strange dreams and is nervous and feeling stressed, but soon she will know the answer to the question she's wanted to know but been too frightened to ask almost all of her life.\r\n\r\nLittle is said on the car journey to the hospital.\r\n\r\nEmma Hobson comes to the door of her office in the neurology outpatients department.\r\n\r\n\"Come in and have a seat Jacqueline,\" she says. \"Welcome, I've got your result, and it's good news. Have a look.\r\n\r\n\"'Normal' it says on there. It's very good news.\"\r\n\r\nText by Sarah McDermott\r\n\r\n\"The doctor said to us: 'I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.'

But his breakthrough came completely by chance, after he saved the life of a famous Argentine writer.\r\n\r\nWithout a job, Javier Artigas needed money to support his family, so he decided to rent out space in his Montevideo home on the home-sharing site, Airbnb.\r\n\r\nIt went well. One of his guests was the well-known Argentine writer, Hern\u00e1n Casciari. But two days into his stay, Casciari had a heart attack. He needed to get to hospital quickly.\r\n\r\nAs chance would have it, Artigas's wife, Alejandra, worked for the Uruguayan senate, and was able to organise a police escort to speed up the journey. Instead of 40 minutes it took just 12. That, and the blood they donated, saved Casciari's life.\r\n\r\nLater, once he had recovered and returned to Argentina, the writer left Javier and his wife a five-star review.\r\n\r\n\"Excellent house for sedentary travellers prone to myocardial infarctions. The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals. Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you. They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while doctors give you a bypass. They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read and they let you stay in their house extra nights without charging you. Highly recommend.\"\r\n\r\nTranslation: With the great @Casciari at home, alive and kicking!! Hugs from all the family!\r\n\r\nBut Artigas was more than a good host and Casciari's newly found guardian angel - he knew from personal experience just how hard it can be to be ill when you're far away from home.\r\n\r\nFind out more\r\n\r\nJavier Artigas spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service\r\n\r\nYou can listen again on the BBC iPlayer\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Artigas was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, which caused his kidney function to decline rapidly. By 2014, he required haemodialysis treatment three times a week to do the work his kidneys no longer could. Each dialysis session - during which his blood would pass through an external waste-removing filtration machine before returning to his body - took four hours.\r\n\r\nFor patients like Artigas, their dialysis sessions need to be set in stone to prevent dangerous toxins from building up in the blood. Regular appointments cannot be missed, so visiting a foreign country where you may not speak the language, understand medical regulations, or be able to find affordable treatment, is a huge challenge.\r\n\r\nArtigas's job involved lots of travel to Latin American and African countries where there was a further problem - finding somewhere safe to have dialysis, with uncontaminated water. After he revealed his condition and his need for dialysis to his employers he lost his job.\r\n\r\n\"I had four children and I didn't know what to do,\" he says. \"Nobody was going to hire me. To be unemployed was a whole unknown world for me. I went into a crisis because I was my family's breadwinner - a deep emotional crisis.\"\r\n\r\nImage caption Javier Artigas having dialysis\r\n\r\nIt's estimated that chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects one in 10 people around the world, with millions dying every year due to lack of affordable treatment.\r\n\r\nArtigas eventually managed to find work in IT, but this also involved some foreign travel. On one occasion he was sent to C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, where he had arranged a dialysis session, but when he arrived he was told that there was no record of his appointment. He had no access to the vital treatment he needed because he wasn't a resident of Argentina.\r\n\r\nAfter almost 12 hours of desperate searching, terrified he was going to die from the toxins in his blood, he managed to find a hospital willing to provide him with dialysis.\r\n\r\nPeople used to try and find a dialysis centre first, and then plan their holiday - we do it the other way around Javier Artigas\r\n\r\n\"On my way back, on that 2,000km trek, I started thinking about this problem,\" he says.\r\n\r\nIt was a wake-up call. He decided he wanted to do something to help dialysis users, and in 2015 he developed an app, Connectus, to connect kidney patients with treatment centres when away from home.\r\n\r\n\"People used to try and find a dialysis centre first, and then plan their holiday,\" says Artigas. \"We do it the other way around. You find the beach where you want to go and we'll find the dialysis centre for you.\"\r\n\r\nConnectus initially launched in August 2015 as a small web platform, costing just $1,700. It focused on connecting patients from Uruguay with a small number of dialysis centres in Argentina and Brazil, the most popular destinations for Uruguayan tourists.\r\n\r\nA month later, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave Connectus its prestigious Best Innovative Healthcare Solution award. This was a big success, but the breakthrough that enabled Artigas to expand the project to serve people in nearly 150 countries, providing access to more than 14,500 dialysis machines, came about in the most unexpected way - as a result of Hern\u00e1n Casciari's Airbnb review.\r\n\r\nUnbeknown to Artigas, an Airbnb representative in Miami had forwarded the review to Joe Gebbia, the company's multi-billionaire co-founder, who read it and sent Artigas an email.\r\n\r\nOn 31 December 2015, Artigas and his wife were driving to a beach 100km east of Montevideo to celebrate New Year when Gebbia's email arrived. It said he would like to fly to Uruguay to stay with Artigas's family.\r\n\r\nAt first, Artigas thought it was a hoax. But he handed the phone to his wife, and she replied to the email. Within an hour Gebbia had booked his flight. He would spend New Year's Eve in the air and arrive on New Year's Day.\r\n\r\nAs the two men got to know each other, Artigas asked what had driven Gebbia to make his sudden visit to Uruguay.\r\n\r\n\"He said, 'I've come here because I want to hear first-hand your story. I want to know every detail. I want to know your blood type. Everything you've gone through.\"\r\n\r\nArtigas had not planned on talking to Gebbia about his app, Connectus, but he had already heard about it and asked lots of questions about that too.\r\n\r\nGebbia spent most of his time in Montevideo relaxing and reading in the garden. Then one day he told Artigas to go to his computer and look for an email from San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was going to be payment for his stay at my house - I wasn't going to charge him. Then all of a sudden I see that there's a contract to go into business with his company. I couldn't believe it,\" he says.\r\n\r\nSince then Connectus Medical has gone from strength to strength. It's not the only app or website of its kind, but it has now been used by nearly 250,000 patients.\r\n\r\nArtigas's precarious finances have stabilised and his health has also improved.\r\n\r\nKidney disease runs in the Artigas family. Javier's 22-year-old daughter has it, and his father died of it at the age of 48, only a few years older than Artigas is now.\r\n\r\nOn 9 August 2017, Artigas had a kidney transplant that changed his life. Two days later, on the anniversary of his father's death, while recovering in the intensive care unit, his doctor played him El Chiquil\u00edn de Bach\u00edn on the bandoneon, to help him relax. Little did the doctor know, El Chiquil\u00edn de Bach\u00edn - The Little Boy from the Tavern - was what his father used to call him.\r\n\r\nIt was a special moment.

We are committed to achieving the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality and strive to avoid knowingly or materially misleading our audiences.\r\n\r\n\"Our commitment to impartiality is at the heart of that relationship of trust. In all our output we will treat every subject with an impartiality that reflects the full range of views.

We also know that audiences want to understand more about how BBC journalism is produced.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, BBC News is making even greater efforts to explain what type of information you are reading or watching on our website, who and where the information is coming from, and how a story was crafted the way it was. By doing so, we can help you judge for yourself why BBC News can be trusted.\r\n\r\nWe are also making these indicators of trustworthy journalism \"machine-readable\", meaning that they can be picked up by search engines and social media platforms, helping them to better identify reliable sources of information too.\r\n\r\nThese indicators comprise the following areas:\r\n\r\nBEST PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe BBC has long had its own Editorial Guidelines that apply to all of our content and set out the standards expected of our journalists. To make it easier to see how BBC guidelines are used in our newsroom, we have listed all the relevant sections on this page.\r\n\r\nMission Statement: The mission of the BBC is to act in the public interest, serving all audiences through the provision of impartial, high-quality and distinctive output and services that inform, educate and entertain. Full details are in the BBC Charter.\r\n\r\nOwnership Structure, Funding and Grants: We are independent of outside interests and arrangements that could undermine our editorial integrity. Our audiences should be confident that our decisions are not influenced by outside interests, political or commercial pressures, or any personal interests.

Policies relating to corrections can be found in the following sections of our Editorial Guidelines.\r\n\r\nOur output must be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. We should be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation. Claims, allegations, material facts and other content that cannot be corroborated should normally be attributed.\r\n\r\nWe are open in acknowledging mistakes when they are made and encourage a culture of willingness to learn from them.\r\n\r\nIf an article has been edited since publication to correct a material inaccuracy, a note will be added at the end of the text to signal to the reader there has been an amendment or correction with the date of that change. If there is a small error in a story that does not alter its editorial meaning (eg name misspelling), the correction will be made without an additional note.\r\n\r\nUnless content is specifically made available only for a limited time period, there is a presumption that material published online will become part of a permanently accessible archive and will not normally be removed. Exceptional circumstances may include legal reasons, personal safety risks, or a serious breach of editorial standards that cannot be rectified except by removal of the material.\r\n\r\nOther links:\r\n\r\nVerification/Fact-checking Standards: The BBC's accuracy and verification policy is outlined in the Editorial Guidelines on Accuracy.\r\n\r\nOther links:\r\n\r\nUnnamed Sources: The BBC's policy and guidance on the use of anonymous sources is detailed in the Editorial Guidelines.\r\n\r\nOther links:\r\n\r\nActionable Feedback: The BBC's complaints procedure is outlined in the BBC Complaints Framework.\r\n\r\nOther links:\r\n\r\nLeadership: Meet the senior executive team that runs the news division: BBC News Board.\r\n\r\nJOURNALIST EXPERTISE\r\n\r\nBBC News articles based on original reporting carry bylines (the name of the journalist), as often do those authored by journalists who have a subject specialism.\r\n\r\nGeneral news stories, which tend to combine information from a variety of sources, including news agencies, BBC Newsgathering and BBC broadcast output, or which may have been produced by several members of staff over the course of the day, do not as a rule carry bylines.\r\n\r\nArticle bylines for many correspondents and editors link to individual blog pages, where biographical information, expertise, and social media details can be found.\r\n\r\nTYPE OF WORK\r\n\r\nBBC News distinguishes between factual reporting and opinion. We use machine-readable labels in six categories:\r\n\r\nNews - Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources\r\n\r\n- Journalism based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources Analysis - Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trends\r\n\r\n- Output primarily based on the specialist knowledge of an author, whether a BBC journalist or outside expert, to help you understand complex current affairs and trends Ask the Audience - Content created primarily to elicit direct audience response\r\n\r\n- Content created primarily to elicit direct audience response Explainer - Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the news\r\n\r\n- Content that provides clear factual explanation of the causes or context behind the news Opinion - BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and data\r\n\r\n- BBC News itself is impartial and does not offer opinions but we do sometimes publish expressions of personal views by outside experts, advocating ideas and drawing conclusions based on the author's interpretation of facts and data Review - Content based on a critical appraisal of an event, a work of art etc, containing first-hand opinion\r\n\r\nCITATIONS AND REFERENCES\r\n\r\nOur output, as appropriate to its subject and nature, should be well sourced, based on sound evidence, thoroughly tested and presented in clear, precise language. We strive to be honest and open about what we don't know and avoid unfounded speculation.\r\n\r\nWhere BBC News relies on a single source for a key aspect of its coverage, we will strive to credit that source, where possible. We usually link to official reports, sets of statistics and other sources of information, to enable you to judge for yourself the underlying information that we are reporting on.\r\n\r\nWhenever appropriate, we also offer links to relevant third-party websites that provide additional information, source material or informed comment.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nFor in-depth pieces of work, such as complex investigations or data journalism projects, we will help you understand how we went about our work by showing the underlying data and by disclosing any caveats, assumptions or other methodological frameworks used - for example, the study-design; the sample size; representativeness; margins of error; how the data was collected; geographical relevance and time periods."}, {"id": 200, "text": "Is social mobility really about school cash?\r\n\r\nHead teachers say that social mobility hotspots are also the places where schools are among the best-funded."}, {"id": 201, "text": "'There's a 50% chance I've a fatal disease.

Piecing together the clues, Chris discovers to his horror that the girl's close-knit group of Orang Rimba was attacked not long after he met them, and a number of them killed. But was the girl among them?\r\n\r\nChris travels into the heart of Sumatra and tries to discover the girl's fate by meeting the men who pulled the murdered tribespeople's bodies out of the river. On his way, he discovers just how much of Sumatra's once pristine rainforests have been replaced by palm oil plantations, palm oil which is in around 50% of the products we buy in our supermarkets.

Some phenomena in the ocean can only be witnessed after dark.\r\n\r\n1. Bioluminescence makes the sea shimmer\r\n\r\nYou may have seen the pictures.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s night-time in an impossibly exotic location. Waves are breaking on the beach. The water is sparkling with electric blue lights.\r\n\r\nThe internet loves an image of a magical-looking bioluminescent bay. You may also have seen travel bloggers bemoaning the real event as not quite living up the hype.\r\n\r\nEven if the latter is true, bioluminescence (in this case usually caused by planktonic organisms called dinoflagellates) is a pretty amazing natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDinoflagellates emit blue light when disturbed, which is why they can be seen sparkling over wave crests, around boats or when a hand or paddle runs through them.\r\n\r\nThese tiny creatures are the most common source of bioluminescence at the ocean\u2019s surface.\r\n\r\nSo-called bioluminescent bays such as in Puerto Rico and Jamaica are among the best-known places to witness the glow. However, the ephemeral phenomenon can be found throughout the ocean where there are dense gatherings of dinoflagellates.\r\n\r\nSometimes dinoflagellates\u2019 population increases rapidly causing blooms, which by day are coloured a less attractive red-brown, sometimes known as red tides. And some, but not all, of these red tides are poisonous.\r\n\r\nEven stranger and rarer than bioluminescent bays are \u201cmilky seas\u201d, where continually glowing water stretches for as far as the eye can see.\r\n\r\nMilky seas have only been seen a few hundred times since 1915, mainly concentrated around north-western Indian Ocean and near Java, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThey are not caused by dinoflagellates, but are thought to be the result of \u201cbioluminescent bacteria that have accumulated in large numbers near the surface\u201d, explains to Dr Matt Davis, Assistant Professor of Biology, St. Cloud State University in the US, who specialises in bioluminescence.\r\n\r\nReports by sailors over the centuries have described milky seas as a nocturnal whitish glow like a field of snow, but scientists have had little chance to investigate the phenomenon first-hand.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, researchers analysing archived satellite images found that milky seas could be seen from space and that one satellite had captured images of a huge area of ocean that had displayed the strange glow for three consecutive nights a decade earlier.\r\n\r\n2. Animals glow in the dark\r\n\r\nBioluminescence, the emission of visible light by an organism as the result of a natural chemical reaction, is common among marine life such as fishes, squid and molluscs. In the deep sea most species are bioluminescent, where it is the main source of light.\r\n\r\nIn shallower waters, most bioluminescent fish display their lights at night.\r\n\r\n\u201cFlashlight fishes have a specialized pouch under their eye that they can rotate to expose the light emitted from these bacteria, and they use this glow at night to hunt for food and communicate,\u201d says Dr Matt Davis.\r\n\r\nPonyfish emit light from the bioluminescent bacteria housed in a pouch using transparent muscular shutters, to communicate, he explains.\r\n\r\nCamouflage, defence and predation are among the variety of reasons fishes are thought to emit light.\r\n\r\nFor example, bobtail squid have an ingenious way of using lights. These nocturnal animals have a mutually beneficial relationship with luminescing bacteria that live in a mantel cavity on its underside. At night the squid control the intensity of this light to match the moonlight, and can reduce their silhouette to camouflage themselves from predators.\r\n\r\n3. Moonlight triggers the planet\u2019s biggest orgy\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more romantic than a moonlit night, especially if you are a coral on the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.\r\n\r\nOne night a year in spring, the biggest orgy on earth is triggered by lunar light.\r\n\r\nOver 130 coral species simultaneously release their eggs and sperm into the water during a window of just 30-60 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis mass spawning event might be the most extraordinary example of synchronised behaviour in the natural world.\r\n\r\nWhen the gametes \u2013 eggs and sperm cells - are released they hover for a moment, forming a ghostly replica of the reef\u2019s shape, before dispersing into an underwater blizzard as the sperm fertilise the eggs.\r\n\r\nDr Oren Levy, a marine biologist and ecologist and Professor of Life Sciences at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, has studied this extraordinary event.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is really fascinating phenomena\u2026we know this event is going to happen a few nights after November's full moon each year, three to five [days] post full moon,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\n\u201c[It is] always amazing, in particular I am so amazed how each of the coral species year after year spawn at the same hour of the night.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe adds: \u201dOnce it happens it is always so exciting to see how everything is becoming so live and synchronised. It is almost [a] spiritual event and you understand the power of nature in its best.\u201d\r\n\r\nMoonlight triggers the phenomenon by acting as a synchroniser or \u201calarm\u201d probably with other environmental signals such as sunset timings, water temperature and tides to cue the time of the gamete [egg and sperm cells] release, explains Dr Levy.\r\n\r\nHe adds that corals seem to possess photoreceptors that detect the phases of the moon, which helps with the \u201cfine tuning\u201d of the gamete release.\r\n\r\n4. Sharks and seals rely on celestial light\r\n\r\nFor some seals, moonlit nights spell danger.\r\n\r\nDuring winter months, the 60,000 cape fur seals on Sea Island in False Bay, South Africa run the gauntlet of being picked off by great white sharks patrolling the seas when they enter and exit the water.\r\n\r\nOne study in 2016 hypothesised seals swimming at night during a full moon are at more risk of being eaten by a shark since bright moonlight silhouetting them against the surface makes them an easy meal for predators lurking below.\r\n\r\nHowever, most shark attacks on seals happen just after sunrise. Researchers behind the study, which measured shark attacks at dawn, were surprised to find seals were much less likely to be predated at this time of day if there was a full moon.\r\n\r\nThe researchers theorised that lunar illumination combined with emerging sunlight may decrease the stealth ability of the sharks and that the advantage switched from sharks to seals as night turned to day.\r\n\r\nAnd seals may rely on another celestial feature to navigate - the stars.\r\n\r\nCaptive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are able to locate a single lodestar and steer by it, researchers have shown.\r\n\r\nDuring a test using a simulated night sky, seals swam towards the brightest star and could orientate themselves when the stars were swivelled around.\r\n\r\nIn the wild, seals need to navigate the open ocean to find foraging grounds that may be separated by hundreds of kilometres.\r\n\r\nResearcher Dr Bjorn Mauck said at the time: \"Seals might learn the position of the stars relative to foraging grounds during dawn and dusk when they can see both the stars and landmarks at the coast.\"\r\n\r\n5. Strange animals come to the surface every night\r\n\r\nUnder the cover of darkness rarely seen creatures migrate to the ocean\u2019s surface to feed.\r\n\r\nThe Humboldt squid, also known as the jumbo squid, is one of the most eye-catching marine animals you can see lurking in surface waters.\r\n\r\nBy day the squid lurk in the deep waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean along the deep shelf that runs off the west coast of the Americas and every night they are one of the many ocean animals to migrate upwards to find dinner.\r\n\r\nVertical (or diel) migration - when ocean animals swim to the surface at dusk and disappear down again at dawn \u2013 is extremely common.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat [Humbioldt squid are] doing largely is following their main food item, which is the so-called lantern fish,\u201d explains Professor Paul Rodhouse, an Emeritus Fellow for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and former head of the organisation\u2019s biological sciences division.\r\n\r\nIn turn, lantern fish follow vertically migrating zooplankton.\r\n\r\nSince zooplankton are depended on by so many ocean animals, \u201cthe rest of the food chain will be following on after it,\u201d says Prof Rodhouse.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is a huge movement of biomass every day,\u201d says Prof Rodhouse. \u201cMore than a thousand metres. Some of the oceanic squid probably migrate over 1000m every day.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe adds that almost all pelagic species (animals that live in the water column not near the bottom or shore) that can swim make the journey.\r\n\r\nHumboldt squid are among the most striking creatures to surface every night. Their ability to change colour and flash bright red when agitated has earned them the nickname \u201cred devils\u201d. Although much smaller than their cousin, the 13m-giant squid, they can reach a length of about 1.5m (almost 5ft). Highly aggressive predators, they capture prey with strong tentacles and suckers and tear into it with powerful beaks, and have reportedly occasionally attacked humans.\r\n\r\nBut even ferocious Humboldts are preyed upon by bigger predators such as billfish, swordfish and sharks.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course what they are all doing [by being active at night] is avoiding predation by the top predators,\u201d says Prof Rodhouse. \"The big predators that are visual predators and which stay in the surface waters and see their prey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo they\u2019re all\u2026 reducing the risk of being preyed on by going down into deep, dark waters at night.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more incredible ocean stories, follow OurBluePlanet on Twitter.

I'm still searching,\" says Jamie Mitchell, World Surf League Big Wave Tour surfer.\r\n\r\nFrom highly skilled professional athletes to hobbyists after the rush of the open waves, surfing is enjoyed by people from all walks of life, from all over the planet. All you need is ocean (but not always), a board of some kind, waves, and a lot of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWhile the tricks and twists of seasoned professionals amaze us, below the surface lies a raft of surfing science as impressive as the feats performed on the waves.\r\n\r\nOne wave could power over 30 million smartphones\r\n\r\nAnyone who has watched waves crashing will have a sense of their enormous power and it is this power that may prove to be one of the most promising sources for renewable energy; potentially supplying 10% of global needs.\r\n\r\nWaves are formed in a number of ways, but in most cases they are created by wind blowing over the surface of the ocean. As long as the wave travels forward slower than the speed of the wind, energy will be transferred from the wind to the wave.\r\n\r\nThere are clever and complicated equations that can accurately determine the amount of energy in a wave, but to put it simply the bigger the wave, the bigger the power and there are few places on Earth where the waves are as big as they are at Nazare in Portugal.\r\n\r\nThese monster Portuguese waves can reach epic proportions of over 100ft (30.5m) thanks to a combination of the location of the coast and the unique undersea features. Waves generated by storms in the North Atlantic are focused by a deep, arrow-shaped canyon 16,000ft (4877m) below the ocean's surface; these deep water waves then approach the shallow waters of the shore and start to climb up, meaning the waves at Nazare can get big. Real big!\r\n\r\n\"Nazare is like a 7th wonder of the World,\" says Mitchell (who is the defending Nazare Challenge winner).\r\n\r\n\"To surf waves at Nazare is an honour. You sort of feel like you're back in the day of the gladiators when the world is watching and you're trying to survive and perform at the same time,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\"To surf waves at Nazare is an honour.\"\r\n\r\nImagine the energy in a wave that stands as tall as an eight-storey building. It is estimated some of the waves at Nazare hold enough energy to power over 30 million smartphone batteries. It could be the ideal location for wave energy farms to harvest all that untapped power.\r\n\r\nWaves hide amazing secrets\r\n\r\nAside from Nazare, there are a few other \u2018big wave\u2019 spots around the world where the perfect conditions come together to create the kind of waves that surfers dream of.\r\n\r\nTeahupo\u02bbo village on the south-west coast of Tahiti is one such place. The waves here are big and steep and with the very real threat of falling onto its razor-sharp reef it has attracted the world\u2019s best and bravest (perhaps craziest) surfers.\r\n\r\nThe waves at Teahupo\u02bbo are what scientists call \u201csurging waves\u201d; they aren\u2019t the tallest (the biggest waves are about 30ft / 9.1m high), but they are super thick, formed when deep water suddenly meets a shallow sharp shoreline.\r\n\r\nTahiti is a volcanic island and its rapidly growing reef creates a steep break (the point where the top of the wave starts to overtake the bottom causing it to spill over). This should result in large, uneven waves, but the waves at Teahupo\u02bbo are unique and it's all down to geology.\r\n\r\nFresh water running down from Tahiti's mountainous region creates channels in the ocean floor where coral cannot grow. These channels funnel water from the shore back into the deeper ocean, creating clean waves and a fast current.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the water coming through the channels builds up the thickness of the wave, making it look like the ocean is rising up, rather than a normal wave\u2019s ripple. The shore is extremely steep and the coral can\u2019t grow too deep leading to a more gradual wave.\r\n\r\nAll of these conditions come together to create a wave so intense Teahupo\u02bbo is known as one of the best and most unique \u2018big wave\u2019 surfing spots on the planet.\r\n\r\nSurfers can travel faster than city traffic\r\n\r\nDriving through a city can be painfully slow at times, particularly during rush hour. So it\u2019ll come as no surprise that average vehicle speed in Europe\u2019s most congested cities is only around 30km per hour (18.6mph), with London faring particularly badly at 19km per hour (11.8mph); a horse-drawn carriage could almost match this speed!\r\n\r\nIt was during the 2011 World Surf League\u2019s World Tour circuit in Australia that professional surfer Mick Fanning (nicknamed White Lightning) had his speed measured at an impressive 39.1km per hour (24.3mph); almost 10km per hour faster than you could drive around a city.\r\n\r\nOcean animals inspiring surf technology\r\n\r\nFound on the underside of a surfboard, fins are critical to the stability, feel and control of the board. Traditionally, fins were rigid and made of wood, but advances in plastics and composite materials have produced fins that allow for greater control while turning on a wave.\r\n\r\nNow it seems the future is in fins that mimic whale flippers.\r\n\r\nWhales may be massive, but they are also graceful, and it is their ingenious flippers that help them stay so nimble. Their fins allow them to perform some impressive underwater acrobatics, especially in their tight, controlled turns.\r\n\r\nTaking cues from whale's fabulous flippers is a new type of fin that flexes from the stiff edge at the front, which first makes contact with the water (leading edge) when in motion, to the fin\u2019s rear edge (trailing edge), with flexibility increasing as the fin tapers from front to back. It also flexes from the base to the tip, like conventional fins do, creating more speed in the turn as the flexing fin snaps back into place.\r\n\r\nA second, more radical, fin design has a bumpy irregular surface along the leading edge, modelled after the tubercles on a humpback whale\u2019s flipper. As water flows over their flippers the large bumps create channels of fast-moving water which let the whale \u2018grip\u2019 the water at sharper angles, tightly turning and circling, even at slow speed.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just innovative board designs that animals have helped influence, but also the future of surf wear. In an effort to create a more efficient wetsuit (key for surfers who need to stay warm and agile on the waves), MIT engineers looked to the fur of beavers and sea otters for inspiration.\r\n\r\nThese semi-aquatic mammals have remarkable fur that traps pockets of air to keep them warm and dry when diving under water. The MIT team fabricated fur-like rubbery pelts mimicking this unique ability to help them understand and ultimately recreate the effect.\r\n\r\nA furry wetsuit designed for surfers and inspired by beavers, is very nearly a reality.\r\n\r\nSurfboards to monitor our oceans\r\n\r\nScientists know that the world\u2019s oceans are changing; they are getting warmer and more acidic, leading to rising sea levels, stormier weather, and altered ecosystems and animal behaviour.\r\n\r\nTo measure our changing oceans and the effects on ocean life, scientists use research vessels, probes, sensors and satellites to collect a range of data from the open ocean, but it is much trickier nearer the shore where the waters can be rougher and much more challenging.\r\n\r\nAll this may be about to change thanks to a neat piece of tech designed by a team of scientists and used by citizen science surfers.\r\n\r\nSmartfin is new technology almost identical to a traditional surf board fin, but with a hidden twist.The fin contains sensors that measure temperature and location for researchers to analyse. In the future, Smartfin hopes its sensors will be able to measure pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and levels of chlorophyll.\r\n\r\nAndrew Stern, founder of Smartfin and Associate Professor of Neurology at University of Rochester School of Medicine, says a Smartfin could help monitor the bleaching of coral reefs due and the populations of shellfish struggling with ocean acidification.\r\n\r\n\"What is unique about the Smartfin technology, and why it has taken four years and millions of dollars to develop, is its tiny size and it\u2019s very low cost compared with existing sensors of comparable accuracy.\r\n\r\n\"What Smartfin offers is a new generation of sensors that can be easily deployed in huge numbers and in previously inaccessible locations,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nDolphins like to surf\r\n\r\nDolphins have been observed riding the crest of big waves towards the shore and heading back out to sea before it breaks; even going out of their way to repeatedly ride the bow waves of large ships and whales, often leaping into the air with what seems like enjoyment.\r\n\r\nSo why would dolphins expend energy and waste time for what looks like little benefit? One theory is that they are playing - the behaviour looks to us like fun, it is done intentionally and voluntarily, and is repeated. Importantly, it is not performed when the animal is threatened or competing.\r\n\r\nEqually it could also be that using the power of the waves is a more energy efficient way of travelling than swimming underwater. The impact of entering the waves might help to dislodge parasites on the skin, or the splashing noise it makes could also be a signal or communication to other dolphins in the area. There may also be free food when done alongside a fishing vessel, and when done in groups it may teach social bonding.\r\n\r\nThe answer could be a combination of any or all these; however, we like to think that perhaps dolphins just love to surf as much as we do!\r\n\r\nAmazing aerial feats\r\n\r\nAerial surfing is a relatively modern and now common part of many competitions. It takes years to master and relies on the speed of the surfer as well as a light breeze over a vertical lip of at least a two-to-three-foot wave. Approach the lip of the wave at the right angle and it acts as a ramp to launch the surfer and their board into the air before landing back on the water.\r\n\r\nThe faster the surfer is riding a wave, the higher in the air they'll go after launch, and the more time in the air there is to pull off an amazing feat - a backflip, a superman, a rodeo flip, or the spectacular sushi roll.\r\n\r\n\"When you try something over and over again but don't quite get it right, the moment it finally clicks is so satisfying and you can't help but smile,\" says Lakey Peterson, World Surf League Championship Tour surfer and current world number seven.\r\n\r\nSurfing is for everyone\r\n\r\nSurfing is enjoyed by people from all walks of life and abilities; all that's needed is a willingness to give it a go and to love the ocean. Standing up on the board and riding those first waves will take practice, but given enough time and dedication you'll be surfing like a pro in no time.\r\n\r\n\"It will be the best decision you could ever make,\" says Peterson.\r\n\r\n\"Consistency is key and once it all comes together for you, you will be so happy you didn't quit,\" she adds.\r\n\r\nJessi Miley-Dyer is World Surf League's Women's Commissioner and former championship competitor and her advice for anyone wanting to take up surfing is to find a surf school and get a few lessons.\r\n\r\n\"Make sure that you can swim confidently and don\u2019t be disheartened if you don\u2019t get it straight away! You will be able to stand up, but it\u2019s one of those sports where you just need to keep trying.\r\n\r\n\"Give yourself a whole summer to cruise in the ocean and be part of the scene,\" she adds.\r\n\r\nYou've read the science, now watch some incredible surfers harnessing the power of the waves:\r\n\r\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\r\n\r\nFor more incredible ocean stories follow @OurBluePlanet on Twitter, and @BBCEarth on Facebook.

To become actually see through, and appear as if you aren\u2019t there, you need to either allow light to travel through you unimpeded, or bend light around you - so that none reflects back at an observer. It\u2019s a tricky task, but some animals are almost there.\r\n\r\nGlass octopus\r\n\r\nIn the ocean animals have two choices if they want to hide. Creatures that live in the deep ocean close to the seafloor can blend in with sand or rocks, or hide in coral. In the deep ocean it is often pitch black anyway and predators lack eyes, so being invisible is not necessary.\r\n\r\nAnimals that live close to the surface and want to hide can produce dazzling displays of light in a process known as bioluminescence, confusing predators below who think they are looking at dappled sunshine hitting the water\u2019s surface. Animals that live in midwater though have neither of these options. This region is known as the pelagic zone, and it also happens to be where most invisible animals live.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the easiest way of becoming invisible is by being transparent and letting light travel completely through you. In open oceans, which lack structures to hide behind, being transparent is a great way of hiding from all viewpoints and angles. It\u2019s so popular in fact that transparency has independently evolved multiple times in completely unrelated animals.\r\n\r\nOne such animal, the glass octopus (Vitreledonella richardi) is so named because it is almost completely transparent. The gelatinous creature can grow up to 45cm (18in), if you include the tentacles. It lives 300-1000m below the surface in tropical and subtropical waters across the world, and is almost completely invisible to predators except for its digestive system, optic nerves and eyes.\r\n\r\nBut what\u2019s the point in making your whole body transparent, if the eyes and guts are still visible? Even worse, these organs will cast shadows on the seafloor below, making them more visible to predators. Eyes need to absorb light to function, so it is not possible for them to be transparent. Guts betray their contents, so unless an animal feeds on transparent material, they will be visible. However the octopus, and all hosts of transparent creatures go to great lengths to disguise these opaque organs. The glass octopus (Vitreledonella richardi) for example has very elongated eyes which reduces its peripheral vision, but minimises the shadow it casts below - making it less likely to be detected by predators hunting from below. There is also some evidence that it orientates its body in such a way so as to minimise its shadow.\r\n\r\nThe glass octopus is not the only transparent animal to come up with an ingenious way of disguising its eyes. Many transparent molluscs camouflage their eyes with mirrors, as mirrors in the open ocean reflect only more ocean and so are invisible.\r\n\r\nCranchiidae or glass squid\r\n\r\nThe glass family of squid, of which there are about 60 species, are almost entirely see through. They live, again in the pelagic region of oceans around the world, between 200 and 1000m below sea level.\r\n\r\nAlthough their bodies are entirely transparent, their large eyes are opaque, which is a problem as predators swimming below can easily see the shadow they cast. However the glass squid (Cranchiidae) uses a clever form of camouflage to hide them. It uses photophores - organs beneath its eyes - to produce light in a trick called counter-illumination. This light looks very similar to the sunlight filtering down from above, so it makes the squid completely invisible to predators swimming below it. However the light could make the squid very conspicuous to viewers looking at it from other angles. Rather than an invisibility cloak, the glowing light could act like a beacon drawing predators to it.\r\n\r\nResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that the squid\u2019s photophores are amazingly able to match the amount of light they produce to that coming in from every direction, creating a sort of omnidirectional invisibility cloak.\r\n\r\nThe tomopteris deep sea worm\r\n\r\nThis genus, or group of marine planktonic polychaete worms are almost completely transparent, making them very difficult for predators to see. Paradoxically at least 11 species in the group can also emit bright luminous colours. Most tomopteris worms glow blue, but one species, Tomopteris nisseni can produce yellow light and is one of only few such creatures on the planet to do so.\r\n\r\nSome tomopteris worms can even distract predators by releasing a glowing part of their body called a parapodia, making the predator chase after the dispelled body part rather than the worm itself.\r\n\r\nSea salp\r\n\r\nA salp is a completely transparent barrel shaped creature which swims and feeds at the same time by pumping water through its gelatinous body. They filter out the phytoplankton in the water to feed on. Although they look a bit like jellyfish they are actually more sophisticated and are closely related to fish and vertebrates - they have a heart and gills and can reproduce sexually.\r\n\r\nSalps have a fascinating life cycle. For part of it they live by themselves, but they then clone themselves and form long strings and other shapes of connected organisms. Individual salps synchronise their swimming by communicating with one another via electrical signals.\r\n\r\nHyperiids\r\n\r\nSometimes being transparent isn\u2019t enough, and organisms need other tricks up their sleeve to remain invisible. This is certainly the case for the Hyperiid, a little crustacean bearing a resemblance to a shrimp. They are able to hide from predators by being transparent. However that only gets them so far. A plane of glass is also transparent but you can still see it if you shine a light on it, as the light is reflected back. This is a particular problem in the ocean because many predators use bioluminescence as a searchlight when hunting for prey.\r\n\r\nA recent study suggests there is more to the hyperiid\u2019s ability to hide than simple transparency. It turns out they are using a kind of nanotechnology to interfere with and bend light, cloaking themselves and almost rendering them invisible. The scientists used a scanning electron microscope to closely analyse seven species of hyperiids. They found that the legs of one species were covered in tiny nano sized hair-like protuberances.\r\n\r\nThe body of this species, and six others were also covered in nano sized bumps or spheres ranging in size from under 100 nanometers to around 300 nanometers. The tiny size of the bumps could minimise light scattering and the scientists found that a combination of both nanostructures - the bumps and the hairs could reduce reflectance by as much as 100 fold. The weird thing is that the researchers think these spheres could actually be bacteria.\r\n\r\nJapetella heathi and Onychoteuthis banksii\r\n\r\nThe squid Japetella heathi and the octopus Onychoteuthis banksii also have a novel trick up their sleeves when it comes to invisibility - they can quickly switch from being transparent to a reddish brown colour.\r\n\r\nThey both live in the Pacific Ocean between 600-1000m deep \u2013 known as the mesopelagic zone. Although being transparent helps a lot with invisibility close to the water\u2019s surface, as diffuse sunlight from the surface passes straight through transparent tissue, when you shine a light directly on something that is transparent, it suddenly becomes very visible.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this happens quite a lot in the deep sea, where predators use light-emitting organs called photophores like a searchlight when hunting. Prey at these depths are often red or black so that they reflect as little blue light as possible. Japetella heathi, an octopus, and Onychoteuthis banksii, a squid, are able to switch between both, but how do they do it? Both species\u2019 skin contains light sensitive cells called chromatophores. The cells contain a dye, and when they detect light they immediately expand and release the pigment.\r\n\r\nSea Sapphires\r\n\r\nSea Sapphires (Sapphirina) are ant size creatures that live in warm tropical and subtropical seas. They belong to a group of crustaceans called copepods. Different species emit a range of brilliant iridescent colours, from vivid blues to reds and golds.\r\n\r\nWhat is remarkable about them is that one second they can shimmer brightly and the next they appear almost to disappear and the way they do this is fascinating. Their skin, or cuticle cells contain tiny crystal plates arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern. The crystals contain guanine, one of the four bases that make up DNA. The crystal layers are separated from each other by a soup-like fluid called a cytosol.\r\n\r\nA team of scientists found that the although the layers of guanine crystals are always exactly the same thickness \u2013 70 nanometers, the thickness of the cytosol between the layers varies from 50 to 200 nanometers. It is this variety which determines the colour of the sea sapphire. Thicker layers of cytosol lead to longer wavelengths of light being reflected, which make the copepod look red or magenta.\r\n\r\nThe colour also depends on the angle of light which strikes them. As the angle becomes smaller and smaller, the wavelength of reflected light becomes shorter and the colour more violet. If the angle becomes small enough then the reflected light is in the UV spectrum, which means that we can\u2019t see it and the sea sapphires disappear. The researchers found that light which hit the crustaceans at a 45\u00b0 angle effectively caused them to become invisible.\r\n\r\nThe glasswing butterfly\r\n\r\nAll of the transparent animals discussed so far have lived in the sea, and there\u2019s a good reason for that. To be transparent you need to be made up of stuff that neither absorbs nor reflects light. This is a difficult task for plants and animals that live on land because there is such a large difference between the refractive index of living tissues and air. The refractive index of a material describes how quickly light travels through it. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, and generally speaking the denser a material, the longer light takes to travel through it and the greater its refractive index will be.\r\n\r\nAs biological tissue is so much thicker and denser than air, when light waves go from travelling through air to body tissue, they slow down. This causes light to change directions and scatter, causing reflections that make the animal more visible.\r\n\r\nIn the sea there is less difference between the refractive index of water and biological tissues, so transparency is an easier task, hence why there are so many \u2018almost\u2019 invisible animals. Another reason you don\u2019t find many see through animals on land is because organisms need pigments like melanin to protect them from UV radiation from the sun.\r\n\r\nHowever there are some exceptions to the see through rule. One is the glasswing butterfly (Greta oto) which lives in Central America.\r\n\r\nAlthough not all of its body is see through, its transparent wings make it difficult for predators to track it during flight. To look at how the butterfly achieves its transparency, scientists examined their wings under an electron microscope. They found tiny nano sized bumps called nanopillars which were scattered randomly and had different lengths. It seems that the random size and distribution of the nanoscale structures help the butterfly minimise reflections from its wings. The nanopillars interfere with rays of light hitting the wing, causing most to pass straight through rather than bouncing back.\r\n\r\nTransparent mollusc\r\n\r\nAnother exception to the rule is a translucent snail (Zospeum tholussum) that was discovered in the deepest cave in Croatia. Scientists from Goethe University, Frankfurt found the see through mollusc living 980m underground in the Lukina Jama-Trojama cave, in a chamber full of rocks and sand with a small stream running through it.\r\n\r\nThe snail belongs to a genus of miniature land snails that are found in dark, underground caves, and which are unable to move by themselves. Researchers believe they use running water from streams to transport themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever even though it is translucent, the snail is still fairly visible, highlighting just how difficult it is for land animals to achieve what those in the ocean do.\r\n\r\nNever miss a moment.

These are just some of the words that can be used to describe an otter. If you\u2019ve been lucky enough to see one of these shy semi-aquatic animals in the wild, you\u2019ll instantly understand why.\r\n\r\nBut despite all their lovable qualities, otter populations all over the world hang in the balance.\r\n\r\nBecause they haven\u2019t always been appreciated (at least not alive), sea otters were almost hunted to extinction for their warm and luxurious pelts. More recently, many species including the common, or Eurasian, otter have been hunted and trapped because they were seen as threats to fish stocks and competition for our food. Sometimes they were even killed for fun.\r\n\r\nIt is not just deliberate hunting, trapping and persecution that cause otters to suffer; they have to cope with shrinking habitats and a shortage of food, are vulnerable to chemicals, pollutants and (for some species) oil spills. Accidentally getting caught in fishing nets, parasites and infectious diseases are yet further causes of fatalities.\r\n\r\nThese are big problems and a tall order for any group of animals to deal with.\r\n\r\nDespite all these challenges, they are fighters with a range of skills and behaviours making them superbly adapted to life on land and in water.\r\n\r\nFound on every continent except Oceania and Antarctica, not one of the 13 species has yet become extinct.\r\n\r\nThis says a lot about the tenacious nature of these members of the mustelid family, but also about the efforts many organisations and individuals have played in their conservation. The approaches and use of technology may differ vastly in different parts of the world, but the long-term survival of the species is what matters.\r\n\r\nSea otters in California\r\n\r\nIt was a close call for the incredibly cute sea otter (Enhydra lutris) though.\r\n\r\nDuring the fur trade of the 1700s and 1800s, the worldwide sea otter population was reduced from as many as 300,000 animals to as few as 2000, explains Andrew Johnson, Monterey Bay Aquarium\u2019s Conservation Research Operations Manager.\r\n\r\nThey were relentlessly hunted for their pelts. With around a million hairs per square inch, it was regarded as one of the most prized animal furs in the world.\r\n\r\nAlong the Californian coast, the southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) was persecuted particularly badly, where numbers in the early 1900s were down to around 50 individuals (from 15,000) and were close to being wiped out.\r\n\r\nThankfully, they are now protected and their numbers have recovered to around 125,000 - though they remain an endangered species.\r\n\r\nHealthy populations have a profound effect on the overall health of kelp forests, estuaries, and coastal and ocean ecosystems, because, Johnson says, \u201cWhen sea otters are absent, those systems often fall out of balance and become less diverse and resilient.\u201d\r\n\r\nMonterey Bay Aquarium in California has worked with sea otters since it opened in 1984 and now operates a successful sea otter rescue and release programme, using state-of-the-art facilities and tracking implants to help them in their vital work.\r\n\r\nTo help stranded sea otters, they have an Intensive Care Unit and multiple enclosures filled with filtered seawater with the capacity to hold 10 animals at one time. To monitor their progress once back in the wild, they use radio transmitters.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe implant the transmitters so that we can track each otter and watch its behaviour following release,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nBecause the batteries last at least two years, young animals can often be tracked until they reach adulthood and reproduce, allowing the team to document the significant impact releasing sea otters into an area has on the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nLargely due to legislation and the conservation work of dedicated organisations and charities such as Monterey Bay Aquarium, there is good news for California\u2019s southern sea otters, as numbers are now up to 3000.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis charismatic and vital species would not have survived without these protections.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need them to survive so they can exert positive effects on kelp forests and estuarine habitats, making those areas healthier and more ecologically diverse,\u201d Johnson says.\r\n\r\nHairy-nosed otters in Cambodia\r\n\r\nNot all approaches to conservation are so well funded, but this doesn\u2019t mean they are any less successful.\r\n\r\nThe hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana) is one of the rarest and most endangered species of otter. In the 1990s, it was thought extinct throughout its range in Southeast Asia due to habitat loss, poaching, local consumption of otter meat and a loss of its sources of food.\r\n\r\nHowever, surveying between 2006 and 2013 at possible habitats confirmed the presence of several small populations. In Cambodia, for example, it was found in four areas; one of the largest populations being around the flooded forest surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake.\r\n\r\nNow the species has been \u2018rediscovered\u2019, it needs to be protected so that the populations can be allowed to grow. And that\u2019s where organisations such as Conservation International have worked to protect and conserve the area and the species.\r\n\r\nAs Sokrith Heng, Conservation International\u2019s lead researcher for the survey, explains, even though there are a number of laws and regulations to protect the species, enforcement on the ground is weak and limited and local people\u2019s awareness of the importance of the wildlife and ecosystems they live in is very limited.\r\n\r\nPoverty in areas such as rural Cambodia can also be a problem and often pushes local communities to use natural resources in unsustainable ways.\r\n\r\nIn response to this, Conservation International took action at Tonle Sap Lake. Their approach was to restore critical habitat, raise awareness in local communities and schools, and suggest laws and regulations to better protect the species. They also established conservation zones, protecting these through collaboration with government and community rangers as well as helping local community fisheries to development alternative livelihoods.\r\n\r\nKey to this was directly engaging local community members in otter research and forming a group of \u2018otter ambassadors\u2019 who help spread awareness resulting in stronger support from locals.\r\n\r\nThis is important Heng says because; \u201cEducating local people means they can share their knowledge to other community members.\u201d\r\n\r\nAn important part of the successful conservation here is ensuring that local communities are able to sustainably use and manage their resources, and that the communities are financially stronger, explains Heng. For example, some community fisheries now have better protection for the otters: they are patrolling the area to stop illegal activities and teaching otter conservation in the local area.\r\n\r\nAt Tonle Sap Lake, these approaches resulted in fewer otter traps and skins being recorded by officials and researchers, both signs that fewer animals were being killed. While ongoing habitat restoration combined with less hunting and greater awareness is helping to ensure a brighter future for the hairy-nosed otter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the technology maybe very different to that used at Monterey Bay, this method of conservation has been just as successful, as hairy-nosed otters now have at least one stronghold in Cambodia.\r\n\r\nIt is a good result for the country and for a species that was once thought extinct.\r\n\r\nUK viewers can watch Natural World: Supercharged Otters on iPlayer.\r\n\r\nNever miss a moment.

The ancient Egyptians were really into them, for some reason.\r\n\r\nReality: From South America to South Africa, the UK to the USA, they will be there. Not only are dung beetles a diverse and multifaceted group of insects, they keep our farmland fertile and our pests and parasites at bay, and even play a part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They do not all eat dung, either.\r\n\r\nThe dung beetle was an icon in ancient Egypt, adorning temples, jewellery and texts. It was the symbol of a god who rolled the Sun up over the horizon each day, just like an enormous ball of dung. To this day, this is the stereotypical dung beetle, the one made famous by natural history films \u2013 a stocky black insect, trundling along with its smelly ball.\r\n\r\n\"I get that a lot,\" says insect ecologist Tomas Roslin at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, \"and then hurry to point out that there are as many different species of beetles living in dung as there are, for example, bird species globally\".\r\n\r\nThe sacred scarab of Egypt is a real animal, but it is just the tip of the dung heap. Dung beetles can be big or small, adorned with beautiful colours or horns to fight opponents, and inhabit chilly grasslands or tropical rainforests. Of the thousands of dung beetle species, only a fraction actually roll their dung into balls, and many do not eat dung at all.\r\n\r\n\"With so many different species that exist globally, the differences in life history are almost endless,\" says Trond Larsen, a tropical ecologist and Director of Conservation International's Rapid Assessment Program. \"Among the most fascinating dung beetle species are those which have developed unusual specialisations.\"\r\n\r\nMost dung beetles work hard to live up to their name. In their quest for dung, some species engage in epic kung fu battles on the savannah. Others take up residence by monkeys' anuses, so they can hop onto the dung as it leaves its owner: a perfect example of \"first come, first serve\".\r\n\r\nBut according to Larsen, it is common to find over 150 distinct dung beetle species at a single site in the tropics. With this level of competition for limited quantities of dung, it is hardly surprising that some have evolved non dung-based diets.\r\n\r\nThese diets would still not be to everyone's taste. Whether it is carrion, rotting fruit and fungi, or dead invertebrates, dung beetles seem happy to serve as nature's bin men, hoovering up unpleasant detritus and waste. One species lives on the backs of giant land snails, sucking up their mucus while enjoying a free ride.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most fascinating specialists are the dung beetles that have made the switch from dung to hunting prey.\r\n\r\nPredatory dung beetles have long been alluded to in the scientific literature. One species from Brazil was recorded decapitating large ants, before leaving their heads behind and rolling the fat abdomens into an underground lair \u2013 as if they were balls of dung.\r\n\r\nMost of all, though, some dung beetles really seem to have it in for millipedes.\r\n\r\nAware of reports that certain beetles attack live millipedes, Larsen decided to go in search of the killer. After identifying a likely Peruvian species called Deltochilum valgum, he captured some specimens to observe their behaviour. \"I was amazed to unravel the highly detailed attack strategies employed by the beetles,\" he enthuses. Once again, decapitation is their favoured mode of attack.\r\n\r\nHowever, thanks to their family history of eating dung, these beetles lack the sharp mouthparts commonly found in carnivorous animals. Instead, they have to improvise.\r\n\r\n\"Successful decapitation of millipedes depends on a suite of morphological adaptations, such as the shape of the hind legs, the prying 'teeth' on the front of the head, and the narrow width of the head for fitting inside the millipede's body segments,\" says Larsen. Essentially, the dung beetles slowly prise their unfortunate prey's body apart.\r\n\r\nMillipedes are commonplace and slow, making them the perfect prey for these makeshift predators. Larsen reckons the evolutionary leap from feeding on carrion and dead invertebrates to living millipedes is not huge, and predicts that other dung beetles will also make the switch.\r\n\r\nClarke Scholtz, a veteran entomologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, knows a thing or two about dung beetles. He says that millipede-eaters are also present across the Atlantic, and agrees that this lifestyle change is actually rather straightforward.\r\n\r\n\"Adult dung beetles are not dung feeders in the strictest sense of the word,\" says Scholtz. \"They feed on tiny particles of gut epithelium from whatever it was that produced the dung, bacteria, fungi and tiny fractions of dung.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, carrion-feeding dung beetles, and those feeding on invertebrates, are slurping on smoothies of juices and insides, filtering out the nutritious particles just as they would with dung.\r\n\r\nDespite their forays into other foodstuffs, the primary business of the dung beetle family is still, well, \"business\". Whether they roll it around, bury it or live inside it, these beetles know their way around a pile of poop, and have done since the time of the dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, while they are not pushing the Sun across the sky, dung beetles are doing important work.\r\n\r\n\"Dung beetles are an essential part of the ecosystem,\" says Bryony Sands of the University of Bristol, UK. \"In my opinion, they are as important as bees, but because of their unglamorous lifestyle their value is definitely overlooked.\"\r\n\r\nFaeces are a fact of life, and without an efficient waste disposal system the world would quickly descend into a swamp of unprocessed sewage. Dung beetles are that system. \"The beetles process the dung by tunnelling, burying, and fragmenting it,\" says Sands. They lay their eggs in it, their larvae eat it, worms bury it further, and the circle of dung continues.\r\n\r\nScholtz puts the situation into perspective. \"We have 15 million cattle in South Africa, and each produces about 12 cow pats per day,\" he says. \"That equates to about 5,500 tonnes of dung every day. We would all be knee deep \u2013 or shoulder deep \u2013 in it if it wasn't for dung beetles.\" And that is before we even consider the elephant dung.\r\n\r\n\"This whole process not only quickly and efficiently removes dung from the surface, it brings all those important nutrients back down into the soil, making the soil fertile and our pastures productive,\" says Sands.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, which is home to a mere 60 species of dung beetle compared to South Africa's 800, the ecosystem services provided by dung beetles could be saving the cattle industry \u00a3367 million each year. Comparable savings have been estimated in the USA. Not only are dung beetles boosting pasture fertility, they also disperse seeds, improve soil structure, and reduce the prevalence of pests and parasites that affect both humans and livestock.\r\n\r\nIn a 2016 study, Sands showed that dung beetles reduce the spread of intestinal worms in cattle. Unfortunately, the anti-worm drugs farmers give to their cattle come out in their dung, and that is bad news for the beetles. \"This is a bit of a catch-22,\" says Sands. \"The very chemicals that farmers are using to treat the gut worms are actually killing the dung beetles, which would be naturally reducing worm transmission on pasture, making the problem worse in the long run.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the tremendous value of dung beetles has not gone unnoticed. Some pioneering scientists have used them to orchestrate major ecological changes.\r\n\r\nThe most dramatic instance of dung beetle intervention began in Australia in the 1960s, when the country was facing a dung disaster. Native dung beetles were used to the dry, hard dung of marsupials, not the sloppy pats left by introduced cattle. This led to farmlands covered with cow dung and bush fly swarms of biblical proportions.\r\n\r\nIn a bold move, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) established the Australian Dung Beetle Project. Over two decades, a team introduced 53 species of dung beetles from around the world. The foreign beetles were able to beat back the tide of manure, leading to a drop of about 90% in bush fly numbers. As a side note, it has been argued that the decline in flies has also saved the country's outdoor caf\u00e9s from extinction.\r\n\r\nSuch was the success of the project that it has been repeated both in Australia and in neighbouring New Zealand, and this is not the final word on dung beetle interventions. \"CSIRO and other Australian and New Zealand researchers have not concluded their efforts in the dung beetle space,\" says Patrick Gleeson, a research technician at CSIRO. He mentions a recent application to develop a new, national dung beetle project.\r\n\r\nTo add to a growing list of dung beetle powers, work by Roslin and his colleagues has also found evidence that dung beetles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\n\"We are talking fairly big effects, like a reduction of 40% of total methane emissions from any single dung pat inhabited by beetles,\" Roslin says. \"Dung beetle tunnels will serve as ventilation shafts, bringing oxygen into the pat. That will shift the balance between different microbes. Methane-producing microbes don't like oxygen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you consider the emissions from an entire food supply chain, Roslin says, the impact of beetles is relatively small. Nevertheless, this addition to dung beetles's CV is yet another reminder of their significance.\r\n\r\nIn Finland, where Roslin conducted his studies, the tiny beetles are a far cry from the ostentatious, mouse-sized creatures found in Africa. But they are still playing their role, epitomising the biologist E.O. Wilson's reference to \"the little things that run the world\".\r\n\r\n\"Remember, dung beetles are not just something you see struggling with balls of elephant dung on African savannahs,\" says Sands. \"They are right here at home on your doorstep, and they need to be looked after!\""}, {"id": 241, "text": "Few things get the adrenalin spiking quite like a big brawl, even if you are just a popcorn-guzzling spectator. But if you want the real ultimate fighters you need to look to nature, where champions compete for more than glory: they fight to survive.\r\n\r\nThe hardest hitters on Earth are highly likely to take you by surprise, and not just because of their speed and skill.\r\n\r\nThe owners of possibly the fastest punch known to science are marine crustaceans called mantis shrimps. They use specialised forelimbs to strike prey with shocking power. The force is so great that the mantis shrimps tear through the water, creating small implosions that generate heat, light and sound.\r\n\r\nSome species have adapted specialised appendages to spear, like a harpoon, while others smash with a club. In captivity, they have been known to break aquarium glass with a single hit.\r\n\r\nMany social insects clash by knocking their antennae together\r\n\r\nSheila Patek's laboratory at Duke University in North Carolina specialises in studying fast animal movements. Patek's team has discovered that peacock mantis shrimps can generate a force peaking at nearly 2,500 times their body weight in less than 800 microseconds.\r\n\r\nPatek says springs, levers and latches are the key to this amazing ability. Within each mantis shrimp's appendage is a four-bar linkage system that manages force. One link pushes against the next, building up energy before it is unleashed through the harpoon or club segment.\r\n\r\n\"Much like an archer, the mantis shrimp stores up elastic energy in advance of the strike and releases it with a latch,\" says Patek.\r\n\r\nThe shrimps also engage in territorial contests. However, Patek and colleagues describe these encounters as \"ritualised sparring\" rather than lethal contests. Competing shrimps first size each other up, and only come to blows as a last resort. On the rare occasions that they physically fight, the shrimps first curl up their armoured tailplates, or telsons, to shield their abdomens. The winner is the shrimp that, like Rocky Balboa, can withstand the most hits.\r\n\r\nPatek has also studied insects called trap-jaw ants. These insects are named for their mouth parts, which can snap shut on prey astonishingly fast.\r\n\r\nHares often fight duels in spring as the mating season begins\r\n\r\nThey also brawl to settle disputes, boxing one another with their antennae to determine hierarchy within the nest.\r\n\r\nMany social insects clash by knocking their antennae together: the behaviour has been studied in ants, wasps and bees. Touching antennae does not always signal a beatdown: for example, honeybees rapidly touch antennae while exchanging food. But for letting others know who is boss, boxing is key.\r\n\r\nIn a 2016 study, researchers used high-speed cameras to record four species of trap-jaw ants boxing with their antennae. The Florida native Odontomachus brunneus struck its opponent 41.5 times per second. The team described trap-jaw ants as \"the fastest boxers ever recorded\".\r\n\r\nAmong mammals, probably the most famous thumpers are brown hares (Lepus europaeus).\r\n\r\nHares often fight duels in spring as the mating season begins. This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a March hare\".\r\n\r\nIt was once believed that only male hares fought, competing for mates by swiping at their opponent with their front paws. However, modern research has shown that boxing matches are often started by females, who are not yet ready to mate and choose to fight off pushy suitors. Females only have brief windows of fertility, so males must be persistent.\r\n\r\nKangaroos also kick in self-defence, as many unfortunate Australian dog-walkers can attest\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the bulging biceps of male kangaroos signal more sexually-charged scuffling. A particularly ripped specimen known as Roger resides at the Kangaroo Sanctuary in Alice Springs, and has become a viral hit thanks to his bucket-crushing guns.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 2013 study, the males' over-developed forelimb muscles are a result of sexual selection. Male kangaroos slap and grapple one another to settle disputes over mates, and bigger muscles give them an advantage.\r\n\r\nBut it is kick-boxing where kangaroos really excel. With his opponent in a solid headlock, a dominant male can drive the message home \u2013 balancing on his tail and pummelling with his powerful legs, which are tipped with sharp claws.\r\n\r\nKangaroos also kick in self-defence, as many unfortunate Australian dog-walkers can attest. And speaking of kicks, a kick from a hoof can leave an even greater impression.\r\n\r\nAnyone that has spent time with horses know they can deliver a mean kick, especially if they buck to deliver a blow with both hind feet.\r\n\r\nA zebra's kick is rumoured to be even more menacing, but the evidence to support this is purely anecdotal. Zebras are known to be harder to tame than horses, which might be why the idea that their kicks are more savage is so widespread.\r\n\r\nThe secretarybird may look pretty ridiculous, but it feeds on venomous snakes\r\n\r\nTim Caro of the University of California Davis has dedicated much of his career to studying zebras \u2013 even going so far as to dress up as a zebra to study them in the wild. In his 2016 book Zebra Stripes, he describes how plains zebras deal with predators. Video footage has shown that the zebras kick lions in the chest, but there is no scientific record of these kicks being fatal.\r\n\r\nOther beasts that can really stick the boot in include ostriches and giraffes. Both have been recorded kicking out at, and wounding, large predators. In 2016, Planet Earth II gave us remarkable footage of a giraffe besting a lion with a well-placed kick. When you consider the ferocious jaws that might be snapping at their heels, it is little wonder that these animals can punt some serious punishment.\r\n\r\nYet these defensive moves are not intended to kill so much as repel. While a chance blow to a spine or jaw could prove deadly, the kicks are mostly a distraction to give the leggy prey animals a chance to run for safety.\r\n\r\nFor truly lethal strikes, we need to look at predators \u2013 especially those with difficult diets.\r\n\r\nStalking through the grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa is a predator researchers have described as a \"ninja eagle on stilts\". The secretarybird may look pretty ridiculous, but it feeds on venomous snakes, dispatching them with a single violent kick to the head.\r\n\r\nZebras are known to be harder to tame than horses\r\n\r\nIn a 2016 study, scientists measured the kicking ability of a captive male secretarybird called, for reasons that are not immediately clear, Madeleine. They found that Madeleine could deliver five or six times his own bodyweight in a tenth of the time it takes a human to blink.\r\n\r\nThis same hunting style may also have been employed by some of the aptly-named terror birds: huge flightless birds that lived in prehistoric South America. Members of the Mesembriornis genus had very strong legs, according to analyses of recovered bone fragments. This has prompted scientists to suggest that the birds might have dished out bone-shattering kicks, as a way to access the nutritious bone marrow of their prey.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should all forget about floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee, and instead focus on punching like a shrimp and kicking like a bird."}, {"id": 242, "text": "Build a web, catch a fly, wrap the fly in silk, then devour at leisure. This hunting strategy has proven so effective that orb-weaving spiders are one of the most successful groups of animals. They are found in almost every corner of the world and there are more than 3,000 species.\r\n\r\nMaking a web is a fairly sophisticated ploy. As well as multiple forms of silk and glue, the spider needs to perform a sequence of precise manoeuvres.\r\n\r\nBut why bother building your own web, when you can just invade somebody else's and devour the architect?\r\n\r\nA clandestine group of spiders known as \"pirates\" have adopted this nefarious method of nabbing their prey. Their hunting strategies are among the most remarkable in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nPirate spiders are members of the spider group that includes all the \"orb weavers\" \u2013 those that make the prototypical, circular webs we are all familiar with \u2013 but they do not make webs.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they have lost the ability. They can still produce silk, which they use to build egg sacs and wrap prey. But they are anatomically incapable of spinning a web. The number of silk \"spigots\" on their spinnerets is dramatically small compared to their relatives.\r\n\r\nInstead, they invade the webs of other spiders, in a bid to lure and then kill the hapless architect. Gently, they pluck the strings of the web, enticing the host to approach.\r\n\r\nOnce the host spider has ventured close enough, the pirate makes its move.\r\n\r\nFirst, it encloses its duped prey within its two enormous front legs. These are fringed with massive spines, called \"macrosetae\", which they use to trap the host within a prison-like basket.\r\n\r\nThen, the final move: the pirate bites its prey and uses its fangs to inject a powerful venom that instantly immobilises it.\r\n\r\nIt is a powerfully effective hunting technique.\r\n\r\n\"It can be riveting to watch a pirate stealthily wandering while waving its long, first pair of legs to narrow in on the location of the other spider,\" says Mark Townley of the University of New Hampshire. \"Despite many hours spent feeding pirates for our studies on spinnerets, I never became jaded by the sight of them searching for and attacking prey. It was always a marvel to watch. They can wield that first pair of legs so delicately that I've seen them touch prey spiders so lightly without them reacting in any way, not seeming to even notice.\"\r\n\r\nBut we do not yet fully understand how the pirate's strategy works.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it is not clear why the pirate spiders pluck the strings of the host spider's web.\r\n\r\nIt has long been assumed that the plucking mimics the vibrations caused by an ensnared insect. Hence the Latin name for pirate spiders: Mimetidae, or \"imitator\".\r\n\r\nHowever, not all entomologists agree that this is what the pirate spiders are doing.\r\n\r\n\"The behaviour of resident spiders towards pirate spiders and their own prey is quite different, as are the vibrations in the web caused by these two sources,\" says Carl Kloock of California State University Bakersfield.\r\n\r\nHe has an alternative suggestion. \"It seems to me most likely that pirate spiders are mimicking the vibrations of web-invading spiders of the same species, and possibly spiders of different species,\" says Kloock. \"A spider on its web needs to defend its web \u2013 a valuable resource \u2013 from other spiders, who may try to take over the web to avoid the cost of building their own web, or simply try to steal prey from the web.\"\r\n\r\n\"These encounters follow a pretty simple pattern, where the spiders signal at one another, then slowly approach each other, usually until the smaller spider gives up and flees the web.\r\n\r\n\"I think what the pirate spiders are doing is basically sending a deceptive signal representing themselves as small web invaders that refuse to flee, drawing the resident closer and closer until they are within attack range,\" Kloock adds.\u200b \u200b\r\n\r\nThen there is the matter of pirate spider venom, which has evolved to be extremely toxic towards other spiders, including members of their own species, but not towards other animals.\r\n\r\n\"Once another spider has been bitten it ceases to move, whereas fruit flies may struggle for several minutes,\" says Daniel Mott of Texas A&M International University. \"Their toxins appear to be very specific to other spiders.\"\r\n\r\nWhy, and how, could such a strange hunting strategy evolve?\r\n\r\nThe first problem is that the prey spiders are also predators, equipped with fangs and venom. This means they are more dangerous than, say, beetles or flies, and also less abundant.\r\n\r\nSecondly, pirate spiders are specialist predators. While they do sometimes feast on other prey, their main source of food is always spiders. By comparison, most orb-weaving spiders are generalist predators, eating whatever wanders into their web.\r\n\r\nIn fact, pirates are not even capable of capturing other spiders without the web to stand on.\r\n\r\n\"In the lab, if you put an orb weaver into a jar but don't allow it to spin a web, the pirate spider will not attack it,\" says Danilo Harms of the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It needs a web in order to capture another spider.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, the ancestors of pirate spiders both lost the ability to weave their own webs, and became predators of other spiders to boot.\r\n\r\nHarms says the most plausible explanation is that it began with thievery. Pirate spiders' ancestors may have started invading the webs of other spiders, in order to steal the insects that the host had painstakingly trapped, poisoned and stored.\r\n\r\nThis filching behaviour has a colourful name: \"kleptoparasitism\".\r\n\r\nSome of the proto-pirates could have then taken this tactic to the next level, by preying on the host spiders themselves. Over time, they would then have become increasingly specialised for capturing other spiders: evolving unusually long front legs, sophisticated web-plucking behaviours, and spider-specific venom.\r\n\r\nThis idea has been dubbed the \"kleptoparasitism-origin hypothesis\".\r\n\r\nWhatever the reason for their quirky behaviour, pirate spiders are highly successful. Scientists have formally described more than 160 species, and they are found on every continent except Antarctica.\r\n\r\n\"We know a little bit about the biology of a tiny fraction of pirate spiders, but for most of the species we know literally nothing about their life history and behaviour,\" says Gustavo Hormiga of George Washington University. \"For example, virtually nothing is known about the biology of the beautifully bizarre South American tropical pirate spiders of the genus Gelanor.\"\r\n\r\nIn this genus, the males' pedipalps \u2013 modified legs, which they use for inseminating females \u2013 are twice the length of the male's body. It may be that this allows them to inseminate females from a distance. \"In all other spiders, copulation requires that both partners are close to each other,\" says Hormiga. Mating at a distance would be a useful precaution, as pirate spiders are aggressive, possess potent venom, and are primed to prey on other arachnids, including their own kind.\r\n\r\nBut they also have a gentler side.\r\n\r\nIn a study published in November 2016 in the journal Cladistics, Hormiga and his student Ligia Benavides described five new species. Their study also featured the first report of female pirate spiders caring for their young.\r\n\r\nMaternal care is relatively common in spiders. Some merely regurgitate prey for their young, while others go as far as allowing their spiderlings to feast upon their corpse. But maternal care had never been seen in the seemingly \"nasty\" pirate spiders.\r\n\r\n\"In the field, we observed females of Mimetus, Anansi and Ero taking care of eggs and spiderlings. Pirates can be good mothers,\" says Benavides. \"In some instances, females had their eggs distributed evenly in a small web on the underside of a leaf. But if I moved a web or touched the spider, she would gather all the eggs or spiderlings quickly, create a ball with them, and carry them away in order to protect them.\"\r\n\r\nPirate spiders are clearly a tale unto themselves. However, their habit of imitating prey in order to devour another spider \u2013 an act known as \"aggressive mimicry\" \u2013 is not unique to them. It has evolved in arachnids independently at least twice before.\r\n\r\nThere is a genus of jumping spiders known as Portia. These spiders also mimic prey, pluck the webs of unlucky host spiders, and devour them.\r\n\r\nLike other jumping spiders, Portia spiders have enormous eyes and mostly rely on vision to seek out their prey. In contrast, pirates seem to rely more on their sense of touch. In the lab, covering their eyes with paint does little to hinder their attacks on other spiders.\r\n\r\nPirates and Portia spiders are fairly recent evolutionary developments. However, \"pelican spiders\" also feast on other arachnids \u2013 and they are so ancient, they pre-date the evolution of winged insects.\r\n\r\nPelican spiders owe their nickname to their phenomenally large jaws (technically \"chelicerae\") and elongated necks. Formally known as Archaeidae, they are also sometimes called \"assassin spiders\".\r\n\r\nWith one chelicera they spear their prey. With the other, they inject the dangling, impaled spider with venom.\r\n\r\nPelican spiders have always preyed on other spiders \u2013 unlike the mimetids, which evolved from web-spinning spiders. They were first discovered from fossilised specimens in 1854, according to Harms, before living specimens were found in Madagascar in 1881.\r\n\r\n\"So, if you are older than the radiation of insects, what could you eat? Potentially other spiders,\" says Harms. \"That's why they have such strange morphology.\"\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, for some spiders feasting on the flesh of their spidery cousins is a great way to make a living.\r\n\r\nNever miss a moment.

His entry was published and spotted by the late co-pilot's family who got in touch with Jones.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey had never seen images of his resting place,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThe follow-on correspondence meant even more to me than the dive itself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom descending into the massive cylindrical turret armour of the WW1 Battleship HMS Audacious, to seeing the deck of the WW2 wreck SS Empire Heritage covered in Sherman tanks, I\u2019m frequently left in awe of what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nBut these relics from one of the bloodiest chapters in human history are slowly disappearing.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn years to come many of the ships and aircraft lost during the World Wars will be gone forever,\u201d says Jones.\r\n\r\nSince wrecks deteriorate over time, he says, photographing them is \u201ccapturing a point in history that will never be seen again\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnderwater photography and scuba diving is a form of meditation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen you dive on a wreck that has lain on the seabed, sometimes over a hundred years, it's like time stood still,\u201d says Anders Nyberg, a freelance photographer from the Swedish island of Gotland.\r\n\r\nHis favourite technique is to showcase familiar objects in the strange, other-worldly setting of the deep.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt may be a door handle, a vase or a binocular, furniture or a wall with a tool that hangs neatly left on the wall. It is so I like it, untouched, to get the best pictures,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nWreck sites like the SS Thistlegorm, one of the world\u2019s best-known wrecks, are among his favourite to photograph, as the area\u2019s diverse marine life and beautiful corals make rich, wide-angle photography subjects.\r\n\r\nNyberg\u2019s most startling experience, though, was not one he managed to capture on camera.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife were diving SS President Coolidge, which sank in 1942 off the island Esparto Santo, Vanuatu, when the cargo rooms became flooded with blue flashing lights.\r\n\r\n\u201cSlowly we were totally surrounded by this glitter and I became completely disorientated,\u201d he says.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar blue lights turned out to be the biolumiscent eyes of a school of fish. The phenomenon \u2013 thought to attract or illuminate prey \u2013 can only be seen in total darkness, so turning on a torch would have stopped the effect.\r\n\r\nNyberg\u2019s advice for getting the perfect underwater shot is to master your diving and camera equipment before going into the water.

Idol says it is important photographers consider \u201corientation, condition, and depth\u201d before a shoot.\r\n\r\n\u201cA ship can be too large to see on one dive, especially when setting up a photo. Usually, descent lines are set in place or boats are moored to a line from which you follow to the wreck.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you are creating images inside the wreck, it is important to first become familiar with the wreck and then also to follow necessary diving procedures for penetration. This may include setting lines or diving mixed gases and using redundant diving systems.\u201d\r\n\r\nEven to someone as experienced as Idol, wrecks can yield surprises.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sometimes surprised to find schools of fish, invertebrates, and even eels deep inside wrecks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe life inside a wreck is surprising because it feels remote, is dark, and evades currents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very nice\u2026to see how the sea makes from a huge piece of steel a new house for fishes\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very special to feel you are in a place where some years ago there was people cruising the seas on it.

The former is a cargo ship that struck a reef and sank in the 1980s, and the latter a British wartime ship that was attacked and sunk in 1941, killing nine people. The Thistlegorm wreck was discovered in the 1950s.\r\n\r\n\u201cI love to dive in the SS Thistlegorm because there are still a lot of materials from WW2,\u201d says Benitez. \u201cYou can see bikes, trucks, trains, wings of planes... You feel as [though] you were travelling 70 years back.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis advice for capturing effective underwater photographs is to use a \u201cvery wide-angle lens\u201d and to \u201cplay with the light\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn underwater photography, we use many times strobes and artificial light, but in wrecks, it\u2019s very nice to play with natural light, this gives also a special atmosphere to the pictures.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor more incredible ocean stories, follow OurBluePlanet on Twitter.

But though this is true, it doesn't answer the more interesting question - why do we overeat in the first place?\r\n\r\nWhy do I sometimes feel compelled to eat that bit of cake or bar of chocolate although I know I am going to regret it a few minutes later?\r\n\r\nIs it just greed - or is something else going on?\r\n\r\nAlthough self-control is important, there is mounting evidence that stress plays a significant part in weight gain.\r\n\r\nChronic stress disrupts our sleep and our blood sugar levels. This leads to increased hunger and comfort eating.\r\n\r\nAnd that then leads to further disrupted sleep, even higher levels of stress and even more disrupted blood sugars. In time, this can lead not only to unhealthy levels of body fat, but also to type-2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nTo see what can happen, Dr Giles Yeo, a member of the Trust Me, I'm a Doctor team, decided, with the help of scientists from Leeds University, to put himself through a particularly stressful day.\r\n\r\nThe Leeds scientists started by asking Giles to do something called the Maastricht Stress Test.\r\n\r\nThey put him in front of a computer and made him rapidly subtract a number, 17, from another number, 2,043. He kept making mistakes, which for someone like Giles is particularly stressful.\r\n\r\nThen they got him to put his hand in a bath of ice-cold water and hold it there. Before and after these tests, the Leeds team measured Giles's blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\nMore from Trust Me I'm a Doctor:\r\n\r\nOur blood sugar levels rise when we eat and, in a healthy person like Giles, they quickly return to normal.\r\n\r\nBut what the Leeds team found was that on the day when Giles was being deliberately stressed, his blood sugar levels took three hours to return to normal - some six times longer than on a previous, stress-free day.\r\n\r\nThe reason this happens is that when you are stressed, your body goes into \"fight or flight\" mode.\r\n\r\nYour body thinks it is under attack and releases glucose into your blood to provide energy for your muscles.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Stress can disrupt sleep - and lead to comfort eating\r\n\r\nBut if you don't need that energy to run away from danger, then your pancreas will pump out insulin to bring those blood sugar levels back down again.\r\n\r\nThese rising levels of insulin and falling blood sugars will make you hungry - which is why you crave sugary carbs when you are stressed.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of thing happens when you have a bad night's sleep.\r\n\r\nA recent study carried out by researchers at King's College, London found that if you sleep-deprived people they would consume, on average, an extra 385kcal per day, which is equivalent to the calories in a large muffin.\r\n\r\nChildren also get the munchies when they haven't had enough sleep.\r\n\r\nIn another recent study, researchers took a small group of three- and four-year-olds (all regular afternoon nappers) and not only deprived them of their afternoon nap, but also kept them up for about two hours past their normal bedtime\r\n\r\nThe following day, the children ate 20% more calories than usual, particularly more sugar and carbohydrates. They were then allowed to sleep as much as they wanted.\r\n\r\nThe day after that, they still consumed 14% more calories than normal.\r\n\r\nSo how can you reduce daily stress?\r\n\r\nBreathing stress away\r\n\r\nHere's a breathing technique, recommended by NHS Choices, which I find effective. You will get the most benefit if you make it part of your daily routine.\r\n\r\nYou can do it standing, sitting or lying - whatever is the most relaxing.\r\n\r\nStart by breathing in as deeply as you can, through your nose, without forcing it, to a count of five\r\n\r\nThen, gently exhale, through your mouth, to a count of five\r\n\r\nKeep breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth - steadily\r\n\r\nKeep doing this for three to five minutes\r\n\r\nOne of the first things I would strongly recommend is to try to get a good night's sleep.

An electronic receipt is issued as they exit.\r\n\r\nThe store opened to employees of the online retail giant in December 2016 and had been expected to allow the public in more quickly.\r\n\r\nBut there were some teething problems with correctly identifying shoppers of similar body types - and children moving items to the wrong places on shelves, according to an Amazon insider.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Aside from the technology, the shop is a conventional food store\r\n\r\nGianna Puerini, head of Amazon Go, said the store had operated well during the test phase: \"This technology didn't exist - it was really advancing the state of the art of computer vision and machine learning.\"\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nGrab-and-go shopping has been the \"future of retail\" for some time now.\r\n\r\nBut now Amazon believes its time has come - or at least that it is ready for real-world testing.\r\n\r\nThey're calling it \"Just walk out\" and while they won't spill the beans on just how it works, they say it uses \"computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion, much like you'd find in a self-driving car\".\r\n\r\nYou scan a QR code as you enter. After that, your phone can go back in your pocket.\r\n\r\nHundreds of infra-red ceiling cameras have been trained (with Amazon employees as guinea pigs) over the past year to differentiate between customers as they move around the store, and between items for sale, even those with similar appearances, such as different flavours of the same canned drink.\r\n\r\nThere are weight sensors on the shelves to help indicate if an item has been taken or put back. And some items carry a visual dot code, like a bar code, to help cameras identify them.\r\n\r\nAmazon isn't offering any information on how accurate the system is.\r\n\r\nHowever, one journalist attempted to shoplift some cans of soft drink - but the system spotted it and added them on his bill.\r\n\r\nAmazon has not said if it will be opening more Go stores, which are separate from the Whole Foods chain that it bought last year for $13.7bn (\u00a310.7bn).\r\n\r\nAs yet the company has no plans to introduce the technology to the hundreds of Whole Foods stores.\r\n\r\nHowever, retailers know that the faster customers can make their purchases, the more likely they are to return.\r\n\r\nMaking the dreaded supermarket queue a thing of the past will give any retailer a huge advantage over its competitors.\r\n\r\nThe Seattle store is not Amazon's first foray into bricks and mortar retailing. In 2015 the firm opened its first physical bookshop, also in Seattle where the company is based. There are now 13 in the US - as well as dozens of temporary pop-up outlets.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Customers must have the Amazon Go app, and scan a QR code from it as they pass through a turnstile\r\n\r\nImage copyright Reuters\r\n\r\nIn its third quarter results in October, Amazon for the first time put a figure on the revenues generated by its physical stores: $1.28bn.

A report published by the Royal Society and the British Academy suggests that there should not be three but just one overarching principle to govern the intelligent machines that we will soon be living alongside: \"Humans should flourish.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof Dame Ottoline Leyser, who co-chairs the Royal Society's science policy advisory group, human flourishing should be the key to how intelligent systems governed.\r\n\r\nImage caption Isaac Asimov laid out some laws for robots\r\n\r\n\"This was the term that really encapsulated what we wanted to say,\" she told BBC News.\r\n\r\n\"The thriving of people and communities needs to be put first, and we think Asimov's principles can be subsumed into that.\"\r\n\r\nThe report calls for a new body to ensure intelligent machines serve people rather than control them.\r\n\r\nIt says that a system of democratic supervision is essential to regulate the development of self-learning systems.\r\n\r\nWithout it they have the potential to cause great harm, the report says.\r\n\r\nIt is not warning of machines enslaving humanity, at least not yet.\r\n\r\nBut when systems that learn and make decisions independently are used in the home and across a range of commercial and public services, there is scope for plenty of bad things to happen.\r\n\r\nImage caption In Asimov's Caves Of Steel, humans lived closely alongside robots\r\n\r\nThe report calls for safeguards to prioritise the interests of humans over machines.\r\n\r\nThe development of such systems cannot by governed solely by technical standards. They also have to be imbued with ethical and democratic values, according to Antony Walker, who is deputy chief executive of the lobby group TechUK and another of the report's authors.\r\n\r\n\"There are many benefits that will come out of these technologies, but the public has to have the trust and confidence that these systems are being thought through and governed properly,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe age of Asimov\r\n\r\nThe report calls for a completely new approach. It suggests a \"stewardship body\" of experts and interested parties should build an ethical framework for the development of artificial intelligence technologies.\r\n\r\nIt recommends four high-level principles to promote human flourishing:\r\n\r\nProtect individual and collective rights and interests\r\n\r\nEnsure transparency, accountability and inclusivity\r\n\r\nSeek out good practices and learn from success and failure\r\n\r\nEnhance existing democratic governance\r\n\r\nAnd the need for a new way to govern machines is urgent. The age of Asimov is already here.\r\n\r\nThe development of autonomous vehicles, for example, raises questions about how human safety should be prioritised.\r\n\r\nWhat happens in a situation where the machine has to choose between the safety of those in the vehicle and pedestrians?\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue of determining liability if there is an accident. Was it the fault of the vehicle owner or the machine?\r\n\r\nAnother example is the emergence of intelligent systems for personalised tuition.\r\n\r\nThese identify a student's strengths and weaknesses and teach accordingly.\r\n\r\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Several companies are testing driverless cars\r\n\r\nShould such a self-learning system be able to teach without proper guidelines?\r\n\r\nHow do we make sure that we are comfortable with the way in which the machine is directing the child, just as we are concerned about the way in which a tutor teaches a child?\r\n\r\nThese issues are not for the technology companies that develop the systems to resolve, they are for all of us.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that the report argues that details of intelligent systems cannot be kept secret for commercial reasons.\r\n\r\nThey have to be publicly available so that if something starts to goes wrong it can be spotted and put right.\r\n\r\nCurrent regulations focus on personal data.\r\n\r\nBut they have nothing to say about the data we give away on a daily basis, through tracking of our mobile phones, our purchasing preferences, electricity smart meters and online \"likes\".\r\n\r\nThere are systems that can piece together this public data and build up a personality profile that could potentially be used by insurance companies to set premiums, or by employers to assess suitability for certain jobs.\r\n\r\nSuch systems can offer huge benefits, but if unchecked we could find our life chances determined by machines.\r\n\r\nThe key, according to Prof Leyser, is that regulation has to be on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n\"An algorithm to predict what books you should be recommended on Amazon is a very different thing from using an algorithm to diagnose your disease in a medical situation,\" she told the BBC.\r\n\r\n\"So, it is not sensible to regulate algorithms as a whole without taking into account what it is being used for.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conservative Party promised a digital charter in its manifesto, and the creation of a data use and ethics commission.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the rhetoric by ministers has been about stopping the internet from being used to incite terrorism and violence, some believe that the charter and commission might also adopt some of the ideas put forward in the data governance report.\r\n\r\nThe UK's Minister for Digital, Matt Hancock, told the BBC that it was \"critical\" to get the rules right on how we used data as a society.\r\n\r\n\"Data governance, and the effective and ethical use of data, are vital for the future of our economy and society,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We are committed to continuing to work closely with industry to get this right.\"\r\n\r\nFundamentally, intelligent systems will take off only if people trust them and how they are regulated.\r\n\r\nWithout that, the enormous potential these systems have for human flourishing will never be fully realised.\r\n\r\nFollow Pallab on Twitter"}, {"id": 253, "text": "The key piece of advice: \"Do the writing.

In a longer sketch you escalate the one idea through the scene, introducing no completely new ideas.\r\n\r\nPremise Sketches A premise sketch is a sketch in which the situation is funny, rather than a particular character. A premise should be specific and you should be able to write it down in a single sentence. E.g. A man doesn't understand innuendo.\r\n\r\nCharacter Sketches As you might expect these sketches are built around a funny character that drives the comedy. They often have a behavioural, vocal or physical trait that is unusual. E.g. The Fast Show - Suit you Sir!\r\n\r\nAll sketches tend to be based on either a premise or a character.\r\n\r\nGETTING STARTED\r\n\r\nSo now you know the basics, all you need are ideas. The best way to write is to be excited about what you are working on and the best way to do this is to have lots of ideas to pick from. Remember anything can be a sketch premise.\r\n\r\nA really handy trick for all sketch writers is to create an SKETCH IDEAS MASTER LIST, this is somewhere you write down all the sketch ideas you come up with. It can be a notebook, a spreadsheet, or a collection of post it notes whatever works for you. Having a master list means you will never have to stare at a blank piece of paper.\r\n\r\nYou should aim to come up with at least five ideas a day. Here are some simple exercises to help you start generating them.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 1:\r\n\r\nStep 1) Pick any piece of useless information. E.g. It's the six o'clock bus.\r\n\r\nStep 2) Then add any emotion. E.g. anger, despair, sadness, trust, joy, disgust etc.\r\n\r\nStep 3) Let your brain fill in the blanks E.g. Overly trusting bus driver etc.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the basic idea then explore the emotion in the following way:\r\n\r\n1. Explore\r\n\r\n2. Heighten\r\n\r\n3. Intensify\r\n\r\n4. Exaggerate\r\n\r\nUsing different useless pieces of information and emotions come up with ten premises like this and then pick your favourite three.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 2:\r\n\r\nOn a piece of paper create three lists:\r\n\r\nList 1 Occupations Doctor, Policeman, IT technician, Director, Actor\r\n\r\nList 2 Emotions Fear, desire, apathy, greed\r\n\r\nList 3 Locations Beach, Funfair, Hotel lobby, Plane\r\n\r\nThen randomly pick one thing from each list and see what your brain comes up with.\r\n\r\nE.g. A greedy Doctor on a plane - From that see what funny premises you can mine.\r\n\r\nCome up with ten premises like this and pick your favourite three.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE 3:\r\n\r\nYou should now have six ideas you really like. Pick two of these and turn them into sketches using the structure above. (400 word limit for each sketch)\r\n\r\nTO HELP\r\n\r\nHere are five types of sketch the premise might fit into.\r\n\r\n5 TYPES OF SKETCH:\r\n\r\n1. SIMPLE BUT THE IMPOSSIBLE TASK\r\n\r\nA character is trying to achieve something, they have a simple goal and there are obstacles set in their way that they have to overcome. The goal is usually never accomplished.\r\n\r\nExamples: Monty Python - Dead Parrot, Abbott & Costello - Who's On First\r\n\r\n2. FISH OUT OF WATER\r\n\r\nA character is placed in a completely inappropriate or unexpected environment. It can be a comic character in a sane world or a sane character in a comic world. The world they find themselves in usually clashes with their worldview.\r\n\r\nExamples: Armstrong & Miller - WWII RAF Sketch\r\n\r\n3. CLASH OF CONTEXT\r\n\r\nUsing things with a pre-established context, remove them from where they usually belong and take them somewhere new. E.g. Vampires at a fun fair.\r\n\r\nExample: Big Train - Tyrant At Home\r\n\r\n4. CENTER VS. ECCENTRICS\r\n\r\nAn everyman is surrounded by comic characters.\r\n\r\nExample: Key & Peele - Gay Wedding Advice\r\n\r\n5. PARODY\r\n\r\nThis one is self-explanatory, basically just a parody of something.\r\n\r\nExample: The Two Ronnies: Mastermind\r\n\r\nEach of these types of sketch can be combined but in general most sketches fall into one of the above types.\r\n\r\nStart your script with the BBC Writersroom: Script Gym.
